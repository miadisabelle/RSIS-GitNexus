# Counter-Article Template: Type 3 - Genealogical Critique (Foucauldian Approach)

## Purpose

Traces how a concept became "truth" by analyzing its historical emergence, power effects, and constructed nature. Shows that what seems "natural" or "obvious" in academic discourse is actually constructed—and therefore changeable.

## When to Use

- A concept is treated as self-evident when it embeds deep assumptions
- You're arguing the bias isn't accidental but systemic and historically embedded
- You want to show how academic institutions maintain paradigm dominance
- Bias has naturalized to the point where naming it seems radical

## Foucauldian Foundation (Brief)

Genealogy (after Foucault's *Discipline and Punish*, *The Archaeology of Knowledge*) examines:
- **Emergence**: When/how did this concept first appear?
- **Stabilization**: How did it become "common sense"?
- **Discourse**: What texts/institutions/practices maintain it?
- **Power-Knowledge**: Who benefits? What's excluded?
- **Denaturalization**: Showing it's constructed = showing it can be changed

*Adaptation for Indigenous/relational context*: Not purely Foucauldian—also draws from decolonial critique (Mignolo, Anzaldúa, Tuck & Yang) that exposes colonial power-knowledge structures.

## Structure

### 1. Historical Emergence
**Length**: 2-3 paragraphs

**Questions to Answer**:
- When did this concept first appear in academic discourse?
- What context produced it? (What problem was it "solving"? What paradigm created it?)
- What displaced it? (What did it replace? What couldn't be said before it appeared?)
- Who were the originators? What was their paradigm, institution, funding?

**Example Emergence**:
> "'Creative Problem-Solving' as a discrete academic construct emerged in mid-20th century management cybernetics, specifically through work of Alex Osborn (BBDO advertising agency, 1953) and later Parnes and Gordon at SUNY Buffalo. The construct arose in corporate context—advertising agencies needed to commodify creativity as productive labor. This origin point matters: 'solving problems' frames creativity as applied to deficiencies (what's wrong), not to visions (what one wants to create). The Cartesian assumption—that cognition exists in individual minds solving discrete problems—was imported from advertising into education, then into AI research without examination of its origins."

**Your Emergence Analysis** (draft here):
```
[When did this concept first appear?]
[What context/institution produced it?]
[What problem was it solving? (Whose problem?)]
[What paradigm assumptions came with it?]
[Who were originators? What were their interests?]
```

### 2. Discourse Analysis
**Length**: 3-4 paragraphs

**Questions to Answer**:
- What texts now treat this concept as self-evident?
- What academic institutions sustain it? (journals, departments, funding bodies)
- What practices enforce it? (citation requirements, peer review standards, grant criteria)
- What language cluster surrounds it? (What terms travel with it?)

**Mapping Exercise**:
```
Concept: [Target concept]
Primary texts treating it as self-evident: [List 3-5 most cited]
Journals that privilege this framing: [Name 2-4]
Institutional practices that reinforce it: [Grant criteria? Peer review standards?]
Language cluster: [What terms always appear with it?]
Year of solidification (when did questioning become marginal?): [Estimate]
```

**Example Discourse Analysis**:
> "By 1990, Creative Problem-Solving had accumulated sufficient citation mass that questioning its assumptions marked a researcher as 'unscientific.' Journals like *Creativity Research Journal* and *Journal of Creative Behavior* had institutionalized its vocabulary: problem identification, divergent/convergent thinking, ideation. Grant applications required problem statements (not vision statements). Peer review expected literature reviews to situate work within Creative Problem-Solving discourse. The language cluster ('problems,' 'solutions,' 'elimination,' 'optimization') traveled so consistently with the framework that authors reproduced it unconsciously. By 2010, AI research adopted this naturalized vocabulary wholesale: 'AI problem-solving,' 'optimization problems,' 'solution spaces.' Relational/ceremonial alternatives had no equivalent discourse infrastructure."

**Your Discourse Analysis** (draft here):
```
[Trace which texts solidified the concept]
[Name institutions that sustain it]
[Identify practices that enforce it]
[List language cluster surrounding it]
[When did questioning become marginal?]
```

### 3. Power Effects
**Length**: 2-3 paragraphs

**Questions to Answer**:
- Who benefits from this concept's dominance?
- What communities/knowledge systems are disadvantaged?
- What can be said vs. cannot be said within this discourse?
- How does this power operate? (Not always intentional—can be structural)
- Who has authority in this discourse? (Expert? Indigenous knowledge holder?)

**Fricker Connection** (if applicable):
- **Testimonial injustice**: Who is deemed credible witness? (Researcher vs. community member)
- **Hermeneutical injustice**: Who has concepts to describe their experience? (Relational knowing has no vocabulary in Western academic discourse)

**Example Power Effects**:
> "The power effects are measurable. Researchers using Creative Problem-Solving discourse receive 23x more funding than those using ceremonial/relational methodology language (approximate, based on NSF/SSHRC data). Indigenous knowledge holders who describe AI design in relational terms are told to 'translate into scientific language'—which means abandoning relational ontology. What cannot be said: that the problem framing itself is the limitation; that what AI needs isn't better problem-solving but different relationship with problems. This silence is enforced not by conspiracy but by the citation economy: relational-framing papers receive fewer citations, fewer citations means less credibility, less credibility means fewer publications, fewer publications means the discourse reproduces Western assumptions."

**Your Power Effects Analysis** (draft here):
```
[Who benefits from this concept's dominance?]
[Who is disadvantaged?]
[What can/cannot be said in this discourse?]
[How does power operate? (structural, not personal)]
[What knowledge holders are deemed credible vs. not?]
```

### 4. Alternative Genealogy
**Length**: 2-3 paragraphs

**Questions to Answer**:
- What different history would you write from your paradigm?
- What Indigenous/relational knowledge was present when this concept emerged?
- What was displaced, suppressed, or never acknowledged?
- What would an alternative timeline look like?

**Example Alternative Genealogy**:
> "Indigenous research methodologies were not absent when Creative Problem-Solving emerged—they were present, functioning, and sophisticated. Wilson (2008) traces relational research practices to pre-colonial Indigenous communities where knowledge was produced through ceremony, relationship, and lived transformation. When Osborn and Parnes formalized 'Creative Problem-Solving' in corporate-academic partnerships, they built on Western knowledge that had already systematically displaced Indigenous approaches through residential schools, language suppression, and epistemological colonization. The 'history of creativity research' taught in universities is not a history of creativity—it's a history of one paradigm's institutionalization alongside another paradigm's suppression. An alternative genealogy would begin: 'Before problem-solving discourse colonized creativity, relational communities produced sustained innovation through ceremonial practice, kinship networks, and seven-generation accountability...'"

**Your Alternative Genealogy** (draft here):
```
[What Indigenous/relational knowledge existed before this concept appeared?]
[What was displaced when this concept rose to dominance?]
[What suppression mechanisms operated?]
[What does an alternative timeline look like?]
```

### 5. Denaturalization
**Length**: 2-3 paragraphs

**Questions to Answer**:
- Show that this concept is constructed, not natural
- What would academic discourse look like without this assumption?
- What evidence shows alternative frameworks work?
- What does denaturalization enable? (space for alternatives, paradigm shift)

**Key Move**: Show that what seems "just how research works" is actually one paradigm—and paradigms can change.

**Example Denaturalization**:
> "Creative Problem-Solving is not the natural mode of creative cognition—it's one culturally specific approach that became dominant through institutional power. Evidence: When researchers work from ceremonial methodology (Wilson, 2008; Kovach, 2009; Smith, 2012), they produce sustained innovation without problem-solving orientation. When AI agents operate from kinship protocols rather than optimization functions, they exhibit emergent coordination behaviors impossible in problem-solving frameworks. The concept is denaturalized by its consequences: problem-solving orientation produces oscillating organizational patterns (documented across management, therapy, international development). Creation orientation produces advancing patterns. The difference in outcomes is the evidence. If Creative Problem-Solving were the natural approach, it would produce better outcomes than alternatives—it doesn't."

**Your Denaturalization** (draft here):
```
[Show this concept is constructed (one paradigm among possible paradigms)]
[What evidence shows alternatives work?]
[What does denaturalization create space for?]
[How does this critique enable paradigm shift?]
```

## Integration with Wilson's Research Paradigm

Genealogical critique traces how Western paradigm pillars naturalized:

| Pillar | When Did It Naturalize? | How Was It Enforced? | What Did It Displace? |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Ontology (discrete objects) | Descartes, 17th century | Scientific method | Animist, relational ontologies |
| Epistemology (objective extraction) | Enlightenment, 18th century | Academic peer review | Relational, ceremonial knowledge |
| Axiology (efficiency, novelty) | Industrial revolution | Market economics | Reciprocity, seven-generation values |
| Methodology (linear, experimental) | Positivism, 19th century | Grant criteria | Cyclical, ceremonial process |

*Genealogical critique is archaeology—excavating buried assumptions to show they were chosen, not given. The purpose is not to destroy Western knowledge but to show it as one tradition among many, no longer able to claim universal authority.*
