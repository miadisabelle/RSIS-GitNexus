# Core Concepts and Terms

This document defines key terms essential for understanding the creative orientation, structural thinking, and the development of self-contained, integrated narratives within our operational framework.

## Self-Contained Narrative
A document or artifact meticulously refactored to embed all necessary concepts, principles, and contextual information directly within itself, eliminating external references. Its purpose is to function as a complete, independent, and self-sufficient unit of thought or instruction.

## Integrated Narrative Blueprint
A comprehensive, self-contained narrative that not only embeds all required context but also explicitly outlines the structural dynamics (Current Reality, Desired Outcome, Structural Tension) and creative orientation principles guiding its development or the domain it describes. It serves as a holistic guide, ensuring clarity and coherence without external dependencies.

## Problem-Solving (Reactive Orientation)
A mode of action focused on the elimination or mitigation of an existing negative condition (a "problem"). Its organizing principle is the problem itself, making actions reactive. Structurally, problem-solving often leads to **oscillating patterns** because once the problem is resolved, the driving force for action diminishes, and the system may revert to a state where the problem can re-emerge. (Reference: `llms-creative-orientation.txt`)

## Creating (Generative Orientation)
A mode of action driven by a vision or **Desired Outcome** that one wishes to bring into being, independent of any existing problem. Its organizing principle is the desired future state, making actions generative and proactive. Structurally, creating leads to **advancing patterns** as actions resolve tension forward, fundamentally changing the system towards the vision. (Reference: `llms-creative-orientation.txt`)

## Structural Tension
The dynamic energetic disparity that exists between a **Current Reality** and a **Desired Outcome**. This tension is the fundamental driving force for all action and creation. When framed within a generative orientation, it propels **advancing patterns**. When framed reactively, it can lead to **oscillating patterns**. (Reference: `llms-structural-tension-charts.txt`)

## Current Reality
An objective, factual assessment of the existing conditions or situation, observed without judgment, problem-oriented labeling, or preconceived notions. It serves as one pole of **Structural Tension**, contrasting with the **Desired Outcome**. It describes "what is." (Reference: `llms-structural-thinking.gemini.txt`)

## Desired Outcome
A clearly articulated vision of a future state that one wishes to **create** or bring into being. It is the positive pole of **Structural Tension**, independent of any problem to be solved. It describes "what you want to create." (Reference: `llms-creative-orientation.txt`)

## Oscillating Pattern
A structural dynamic where actions repeatedly address a problem, resolving it temporarily, only for the problem to re-emerge later. This creates a cycle of reactive fixes without fundamental advancement towards a larger vision. It is characteristic of a **Problem-Solving (Reactive Orientation)**.

## Advancing Pattern
A structural dynamic where actions are consistently driven by a clear **Desired Outcome**, leading to a continuous and fundamental transformation of the **Current Reality** towards that vision. This pattern generates sustained progress and is characteristic of a **Creating (Generative Orientation)**.
