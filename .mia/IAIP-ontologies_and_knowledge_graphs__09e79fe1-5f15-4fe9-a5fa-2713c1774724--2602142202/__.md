"""Build a **digital relative** — a system that treats every interaction as relational event""" --> Probably libraries that could be developped from our first experiment in `/src/mcp-medicine-wheel` and its drafted UI `/src/mcp-medicine-wheel-ui` will be source of implementation for what we will do or we might work from fresh, I dont know.  There is also `/src/STPB` which is codename lighthouse, both the mcp-medicine-wheel and the lighthouse can create ceremonies. mcp-medicine-wheel was to experiment creating something outside of the lighthouse and I guess that all that we learn will be integrated into the lighthouse (the first draft of the `/src/mcp-medicine-wheel-ui` has very interesting visual that we will keep working on.

"""The coordinating agent IS a **Fire Keeper** — its purpose is ceremony maintenance, not task optimization""" --> thefore, we will have to create a Claude's Fire keeper agent, that is exciting...

"""Relational Ontology where "the thing doesn't exist without the relationship""""" --> when I search on the web 'Ontology Visualization' I see 'RDF Data Visualization' and a clear relationship with what can become ways to represent them into the `/src/mcp-medicine-wheel-ui`, curious to have your point of view on that.  Also, I was thinking of a DSL

`/workspace/repos/jgwill/medicine-wheel/README.md` will be in relation to `/src/IAIP/prototypes/artefacts/IAIP-ontologies_and_knowledge_graphs__09e79fe1-5f15-4fe9-a5fa-2713c1774724--2602142202/V0.md` and what we have decomposed in `/src/_sessiondata/a9a2cbe1-b756-49e4-9cb9-c0b580521ff2/proposed/pde-decomposition-2602169733.md`

I discovered in `/src/Miadi` as usual too many files for the A2A such as `/src/Miadi/A2A_QUICK_START.md`, `/src/Miadi/ARCHITECTURE_A2A_UNIFIED_VISION.md` (`/src/Miadi/A2A*` ) that leads be to consider next advancing on something in Miadi that would enable the agents to communicate, one to orchestrate...
* I would want the simplest scenario for trying that A2A because I am pretty sure it will need refinements...
* That matches """
## Primary Intent

- **Action:** `design`
- **Target:** Relational Coordinating Agent Architecture — a multi-agent system grounded in Indigenous paradigms of relationality with Research Is Ceremony as foundational context"""
- **Urgency:** persistent
- **Confidence:** 92%
""" found in `/src/_sessiondata/a9a2cbe1-b756-49e4-9cb9-c0b580521ff2/proposed/pde-decomposition-2602169733.md`, therefore , the full circle is complete on my side, I want something that I will be capable to interact with when a 'human-in-the-loop' will be required...  I read from `https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/agents/overview#_hand-off-a-session-to-another-agent` --> """Hand off a session to another agent
You can hand off an existing task from one agent to another agent to take advantage of their unique strengths. For example, create a plan with a local agent, hand off to a background agent for proof of concepts, and then continue with a cloud agent to submit a pull request for team review.

To hand off a local agent session, select a different agent type from the session type dropdown in the chat input box. VS Code creates a new session, carrying over the full conversation history and context. The original session is archived after handoff.
""" which makes me see that the agents will have to hand themselves off whatever is needed
