Topics Organized by Narrative Beats, Concepts, and Capabilities
1. Indigenous Research Paradigms & Philosophical Foundations
Research paradigm assumptions and worldview articulation

Ontology (nature of reality)

Epistemology (ways of knowing)

Axiology (values, ethics, knowledge ownership)

Methodology versus methods distinction

Philosophy as "love of wisdom" (philo-sophia)

Indigenous sciences as systematic knowledge structures

Intergenerational knowledge transmission

Bi-culturalism bridging Indigenous and mainstream systems

2. Cultural Iceberg Model & Decolonization
Visible culture (dress, buildings, food, ceremonies)

Underlying philosophy (values, beliefs, ways of being)

Surface-level indigenization versus deep transformation

Cultural adaptation without losing core identity

External influences reshaping visible culture

Maintenance of underlying worldview despite environmental changes

3. Relationality & Relational Accountability
Reality as fundamentally relational

All entities possess spirit (land, knowledge, animals, elements)

Kinship systems creating accountability networks

Entering relationship with knowledge versus acquiring/extracting it

Cognita nullius (knowledge belongs to no one) as colonial framework

Spirituality as recognition of universal spirit

Religion as external manifestation of internal spirituality

Spiritual crash: disconnection from relational networks

4. Wetiko Disease & Colonial Pathology
Greed, arrogance, perversion, deceit as symptoms

Malignant egophrenia (diseased ego)

Consumption creating insatiable hunger (capitalism metaphor)

Loss of reflection and aimless wandering

Absence of skin (kinship/relationships)

Lack of relational accountability

Resistance strategies: laughter, willpower, hiding, spiritual protection

Traditional responses to communal threats

5. Western Academic Burdens on Indigenous Scholars
Expectation to explain worldview (white privilege exemption)

Hierarchical numbering assumptions

Written communication dominance

Shared cultural language assumptions

Never enough/not good enough Western conditioning

External validation dependency

Extraction versus co-creation tensions

6. Pedagogical & Storytelling Approaches
Storyteller-listener relationship dynamics

Blended environment challenges (in-person/online)

Cultural expectations in academic spaces

Visioning exercises for embodied understanding

Conversational versus lecture formats

Recording and consent considerations

7. Indigenist Philosophy (Distinct from Indigenous Identity)
Theoretical framework accessible to all

Lived experience versus philosophical alignment

Rules and responsibilities of adoption

Feminist analogy for understanding accessibility

Recognition without appropriation

Story Synopsis 1: Methodologies Under Scrutiny
Dr. Naomi Chen, a Chinese-Canadian environmental scientist, joins a research team studying salmon decline in coastal waters. Her Western-trained methodology emphasizes data extraction and quantifiable metrics. Thomas Redfeather, a Coastal Salish knowledge keeper on the team, challenges her approach, explaining that salmon aren't data points but relatives with spirit. Naomi initially dismisses this as poetic language, her wetiko-infected training demanding measurable outcomes for publication. When their research stalls—salmon populations defy their models—Thomas invites her to witness a First Salmon Ceremony. There, she experiences knowledge not as acquisition but as relationship. Her ontological crisis deepens: her entire methodology assumes reality is mechanistic, not relational. She begins documenting not just salmon numbers but the web of relationships—water temperature, ceremonial practices, community grief, colonial dam impacts, Indigenous fishing rights. Her department chair demands "real science," threatening her tenure. Naomi must choose: maintain Western methodological purity or embrace relational accountability, knowing academic consequences await. She realizes her struggle mirrors the salmon's—both caught between systems, both needing transformation to survive.

Story Synopsis 2: Ontological Collision in the Boardroom
Jamal Washington, a Black urban planner, and Siobhan O'Brien, an Irish-descended architect, are hired to redesign a municipal park on unceded territory. The city council demands efficiency metrics and cost-benefit analyses. Grandmother Willow, a Cree elder advisor, insists the land has spirit and must consent to changes. Jamal, raised Baptist, initially conflates her spirituality with religion, missing the relational ontology. Siobhan, trained in European design hierarchies, creates numbered phases assuming linear progress. Grandmother Willow refuses to sign off, explaining their methodology treats land as dead matter—cognita nullius applied to place. She describes how wetiko thinking creates projects that consume without reciprocity, leaving communities spiritually crashed. Jamal begins experiencing this: despite "successful" projects, his neighborhoods feel hollow, residents disconnected. Siobhan notices her designs impose foreign geometries that sever existing relationships between people, plants, and gathering spaces. They propose a radical shift: co-creation sessions where land "speaks" through seasonal changes, animal movements, and elder interpretation. The council, infected with malignant egophrenia, demands accountability to budgets, not relationships. Jamal and Siobhan face termination unless they prove relational methodology produces "results." They must translate Indigenous ontology into language that challenges Western accountability structures without being dismissed as unscientific mystics.

Story Synopsis 3: The Dissertation That Refused Extraction
Priya Mehta, a second-generation Indian-Canadian PhD candidate, studies intergenerational trauma in immigrant communities using standard qualitative methods. Her supervisor, Dr. Marcus Hoffmann, expects literature reviews, theoretical frameworks, and defendable conclusions. Priya interviews Auntie Rose, a Métis community organizer, whose stories resist categorization. Rose explains that trauma isn't individual pathology but broken relationality—families severed from land, language, and kinship networks. She describes how Western research extracts stories like resources, leaving communities empty. Priya recognizes her own methodology as wetiko-infected: she's consuming narratives for credential advancement without accountability to storytellers. Her axiology—what she values—is publication, not relationship. Rose challenges her: "Who owns this knowledge when you're done?" Priya realizes her entire epistemology assumes knowledge exists independently, waiting to be discovered, rather than co-created through relationship. She attempts to restructure her dissertation around relational accountability, but her committee rejects it as "lacking rigor." Dr. Hoffmann, embodying academic wetiko, demands hierarchical organization, numbered findings, and objective distance. Priya experiences spiritual crash—her research feels aimless despite following all rules. She must choose: complete a dissertation that perpetuates extraction, or risk academic failure by insisting knowledge has spirit and demands kinship. Her struggle reveals how Western accountability structures—peer review, citation metrics, institutional ethics boards—are designed to prevent relational methodologies from threatening the colonial knowledge economy.
