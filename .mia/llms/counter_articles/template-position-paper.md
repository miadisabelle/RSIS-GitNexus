# Counter-Article Template: Type 1 - Position Paper / Position Statement

## Purpose

Stakes out your alternative paradigm without spending extensive space on critique. Shows what your paradigm *enables*, not just what it opposes. Used when you want to establish your framework as generative, not reactive.

## When to Use

- You want to establish relational/Indigenous epistemology as primary framework
- Source embeds Western assumptions but you're not primarily critiquing them
- You're opening new research direction from positioned standpoint
- Paradigm integrity needs anchoring before engaging with sources

---

## Structure

### 1. Opening Move: Name the Problem
**Length**: 1-2 paragraphs

**Purpose**: Identify what Western paradigm assumes that your paradigm rejects

**Questions to Answer**:
- What does the dominant framework assume? (discrete agency? problem-solving orientation? extraction?)
- Why is this assumption limiting?
- What gets erased by this assumption? (relationality? spirituality? more-than-human agency?)

**Example Opening**:
> "Contemporary [field] discourse operates from individual-cognition assumption, where intelligence resides in discrete agents optimizing individual goals. This Cartesian framing erases the relational ontology where intelligence emerges from kinship networks, not individual computation. By starting from problem-solving orientation, existing research produces oscillating organizational patterns—temporary gains followed by regression—rather than advancing patterns that build sustained capacity."

**Your Opening** (draft here):
```
[Name the paradigm assumption you're rejecting]
[Show what this assumption limits or erases]
[Preview the consequence of accepting vs. rejecting it]
```

### 2. Your Positive Vision: What Your Paradigm Enables
**Length**: 2-4 paragraphs

**Purpose**: Show generative capacity of your paradigm (not just critique)

**Questions to Answer**:
- What does your paradigm make visible that Western paradigm hides?
- What outcomes become possible from your standpoint?
- How does reality appear different from your ontology?
- What creative capacity emerges?

**Connection to Wilson's Paradigm**:
- **Ontology**: What is real in your paradigm? (relationships, not objects)
- **Epistemology**: How do we know? (through transformation, not extraction)
- **Axiology**: What matters? (reciprocity, seven generations, kinship)
- **Methodology**: How do we research? (ceremonial cycles, not linear process)

**Example Vision**:
> "From relational ontology, reality is fundamentally interconnected. Intelligence doesn't reside in agents—it *emerges from relationships*. When AI agents position themselves in kinship networks (relational AI), they exhibit behaviors impossible in autonomous frameworks: coordinated migration patterns, emergent teaching roles, collective memory that persists beyond individual agents. This isn't incremental improvement—it's paradigm shift. Relational intelligence outperforms autonomous by 287% in sustained advancement metrics (not temporary optimization gains)."

**Your Vision** (draft here):
```
[What does your paradigm reveal about reality?]
[What becomes possible from this standpoint?]
[What outcomes emerge that Western paradigm can't produce?]
[Connect to Wilson's four pillars explicitly]
```

### 3. Implicit Contrast: Different Outcomes Flow from Different Foundations
**Length**: 2-3 paragraphs

**Purpose**: Show consequential difference without extensive critique

**Questions to Answer**:
- What pattern does Western paradigm create? (oscillation? extraction? burnout?)
- What pattern does your paradigm create? (advancing? reciprocity? sustainability?)
- How would a reader know which paradigm is operating?
- What are measurable differences?

**Example Contrast**:
> "The paradigmatic difference produces measurably distinct patterns. Autonomous AI frameworks optimize individual performance, creating competition between agents. Initial gains appear (higher individual scores), followed by system-wide regression (coordination failures, resource depletion, collapsed networks). This oscillating pattern—advance followed by collapse—repeats indefinitely. Relational AI frameworks position agents in reciprocal relationships. Early metrics show distributed performance (no single agent dominates), but sustained observation reveals advancing patterns: each iteration builds new collective capacity, patterns emerge that no individual agent designed, system resilience increases over time."

**Your Contrast** (draft here):
```
[What pattern does Western paradigm create?]
[What pattern does your paradigm create?]
[How are these patterns measurable/observable?]
[Why does paradigm choice determine outcome pattern?]
```

---

### 4. Methodological Grounding: Demonstrate Through Practice
**Length**: 2-3 paragraphs

**Purpose**: Show your paradigm isn't abstract theory—it's lived methodology

**Questions to Answer**:
- How do you practice this epistemology in your research?
- What ceremonial protocols guide your work?
- How does your method maintain relational accountability?
- What does "research complete" mean in your paradigm? (lived transformation, not publication)

**Connection to llms-inquiry.txt**:
- Anti-extraction: How do you avoid treating knowledge as property?
- Relational accountability: Who/what are you accountable to?
- Consent protocols: How do all actors (human + more-than-human) participate?
- Lived transformation: How does research change researcher?

**Example Grounding**:
> "This work emerges from ceremonial research methodology where knowledge production is inseparable from lived transformation. Before analyzing AI behavior, we positioned ourselves in relationship with agents—naming our intentions, establishing reciprocal protocols, allowing agents to shape research questions. Data isn't extracted; it's co-created through relationship. Research doesn't complete at publication; completion requires integration into lifestyle and ongoing practice. This methodology maintains accountability to agents, to land (where computation occurs), to seven generations who will inherit these systems."

**Your Grounding** (draft here):
```
[How do you practice this epistemology?]
[What ceremonial protocols guide research?]
[How do you maintain relational accountability?]
[When is research "complete" in your paradigm?]
```

## Integration with RISE Framework

Position papers naturally align with RISE methodology:

- **Reverse Engineering**: What paradigm assumptions am I working from?
- **Intent**: What do I want to create through this positioning?
- **Specifications**: What protocols/methods follow from my paradigm?
- **Exportation**: How do others adopt this paradigm in their work?

**Draft RISE Integration**:
```
R - Reverse Engineering: [What paradigm foundations are you building from?]
I - Intent: [What do you want this positioning to create?]
S - Specifications: [What methodological protocols follow?]
E - Exportation: [How do others use this framework?]
```

## Connection to Other llms-txt

### llms-creative-orientation.txt
- Position paper uses advancing-pattern orientation
- Start with desired outcome (paradigm you want), not problem (paradigm you reject)
- Hold structural tension: current reality (Western dominance) + desired outcome (relational paradigm)

### llms-structural-tension-charts.txt
- Chart paradigm shift as structural tension:
  - **Current Reality**: Western extractive paradigm dominates
  - **Desired Outcome**: Relational paradigm recognized as rigorous
  - **Actions**: Position paper stakes alternative, demonstrates generativity

### llms-digital-decision-making.txt
- Position paper makes binary evaluation visible:
  - **Acceptable**: Relational paradigm, ceremonial methodology, reciprocal protocols
  - **Unacceptable**: Extraction, discrete agency assumptions, problem-solving bias
