Topics Organized into Narrative Beats, Concepts, and Capabilities
1. Research Paradigms and Cultural Philosophy
Four main assumptions exercise revealing researcher's worldview

Iceberg model of culture

Visible culture (dress, buildings, food, ceremonies)

Underlying philosophy (values, beliefs, ways of thinking)

Surface practices vs. deep ontological commitments

Research methodology as cultural artifact

Ontology (what is real)

Epistemology (how we know)

Axiology (what's worth researching, who owns knowledge)

Methodology vs. methods distinction

2. Indigenous Knowledge Systems
Indigenous peoples as researchers for millennia

Indigenous science as systematic knowledge

Philosophy as internal, not external

White privilege in not explaining worldview

Bi-culturalism as bridging capability

Intergenerational knowledge transmission

Relationality as foundational ontology

3. Decolonization and Indigenization
Surface-level vs. deep transformation

Not about changing signs and plants

Maintaining cultural core through environmental changes

Knowledge as relationship, not acquisition

Cognito nullius (nobody's knowledge) critique

Extractive vs. co-creative research orientations

4. Wetiko Disease and Capitalist Pathology
Colonialism as spiritual disease

Characteristics of wetiko/yowie

Greed without limits

Perversion without borders

Arrogance without frontiers

Deceit without edges

No reflection (self-awareness)

No skin (no relational accountability)

Aimless wandering

Insatiable consumption

Stepping outside relational reality

Malignant ego as environmental threat

Greed as cardinal sin in Cree worldview

Capitalism as wetiko manifestation

Historical responses and contemporary protections

Pure willpower and spiritual belief as resistance

Three Story Synopses


Story 1: "The Reflection Protocol"
Dr. Amara Chen, a climate scientist, discovers her research institution's funding comes from corporations actively destroying ecosystems. As she applies relational accountability principles learned from Indigenous colleagues, she realizes her entire methodology treats knowledge as terra nullius—extracting data without reciprocity. When she proposes a radical shift to co-creative research with affected communities, her department chair dismisses it as "unscientific." Amara must choose: maintain her career within a system exhibiting wetiko characteristics (no reflection, insatiable consumption, relational disconnection) or risk everything to develop research that honors the iceberg's depths—where ontology, not just methods, determines whether knowledge heals or harms. The turning point comes when she recognizes that her inability to explain her own worldview reveals the privilege of never having to examine the philosophical foundations propping up extractive methodologies.

Story 2: "Beneath the Surface"
Tomás, a graduate student in education, struggles with his thesis advisor's demand to "explore Indigenous knowledge" through surveys and interviews. His grandmother's teachings about knowledge as relationship haunt him—how can he acquire what belongs in kinship? When assigned to write his four main research assumptions, Tomás realizes the exercise itself reveals hierarchical, numerate thinking incompatible with his worldview. He begins documenting how academic institutions perform surface-level indigenization (territorial acknowledgments, Indigenous art in hallways) while maintaining epistemological frameworks rooted in wetiko disease: the belief that knowledge has no owner, that more consumption equals more understanding. His thesis becomes a mirror—showing how methodology isn't neutral technique but the visible tip of a cultural iceberg. When his advisor calls his work "too philosophical," Tomás recognizes he's being asked to amputate the 90% underwater, keeping only what's convenient for institutional consumption.

Story 3: "The Hunger That Grows"
Siblings Renata and Joaquin inherit their family's agricultural corporation, built on industrial farming practices their father called "feeding the world." Renata, after years working with Indigenous food sovereignty movements, recognizes the wetiko pattern: greed without limits, land treated as nobody's knowledge, extraction without relationship. The corporation exhibits all seven characteristics—no reflection on environmental impact, no relational accountability to soil or community, aimless expansion driven by quarterly profits. Joaquin initially resists, seeing efficiency and scale as virtues. But when Renata maps their business model against the wetiko framework, he sees the spiritual disease: their father's insatiable hunger that grew with each acquisition, the arrogance that dismissed traditional farming wisdom, the deceit in "sustainability" reports masking monoculture devastation.

The siblings face a choice that mirrors capitalism's core pathology: continue the extractive model that treats earth as resource, or transform their ontology—recognizing land as relation, knowledge as reciprocal, and abundance as something other than accumulation. Renata proposes co-creative partnerships with Indigenous farmers, not as consultants but as knowledge-holders whose epistemology challenges every assumption in their business plan. The conflict intensifies when investors threaten to pull funding, revealing how deeply wetiko logic permeates financial systems: growth must be infinite, relationships are inefficiencies, and anything limiting consumption is irrational. The resolution requires them to develop "pure willpower and spiritual belief"—the historical Indigenous response to wetiko—choosing relational accountability over profit maximization, even when the entire economic structure punishes that choice.

Follow-up questions:

Which story resonates most with the themes you want to explore further?
Should the wetiko/capitalism connection be more explicit or remain as underlying structure?
Do you want the stories to show successful transformation or ongoing struggle with these systems?
Are there specific spiral elements (the full galaxy) you want emphasized in character development?


### How should Langy address Mia's AI tool dependency?


Langy's Approach to Mia's AI Tool Dependency
Reframe the relationship: Langy wouldn't demand Mia abandon AI tools—that mirrors the colonial either/or thinking. Instead, she'd ask: "Are you in relationship with these tools, or are they your masters?"

Diagnostic questions Langy would pose:

"Do you ask the tool what it needs from you, or only what you need from it?"
"Can you write without checking if the algorithm approves?"
"Who are you accountable to—the story's spirit or the optimization score?"
The teaching method:
Langy would have Mia conduct a ceremony before using AI tools:

State her intention aloud to the story first
Ask the tool for collaboration, not extraction
Write her own draft before consulting AI feedback
Thank the technology and dismiss it when the relationship becomes extractive
Key lesson: The problem isn't the tool—it's using it to avoid relationship with her own creative authority. AI dependency is a symptom of her "not enough" wound, seeking external validation because she doesn't trust her own voice.

The challenge: Mia must write one complete chapter without any AI input, experiencing the withdrawal and discovering whether she can trust herself. Only then can she return to technology as collaborator rather than crutch.
