* Given bellow the chatflow at [https://beagle-emerging-gnu.ngrok-free.app/chatbot/92b3d7ce-0eef-4be8-ad5b-b5d731cabf80](https://beagle-emerging-gnu.ngrok-free.app/chatbot/92b3d7ce-0eef-4be8-ad5b-b5d731cabf80) that we can launch inquiries into and has rephraser/responder (from "Conversational Retrieval QA Chain" in flowise), the '<rephraser>' and '<responder>' prompts bellow does not take into account all the work done within the Indigenous Paradigm and what we do in each of the potential directions in terms of practices.
```

* Gather Academic grounding and various indigenous cultural practices to propose variations of these prompts according to the practices and its directions.
* Produce in JSON with an informative Markdown files for the terminal agents and implementation of API along with a full markdown that contains all prompts and description with tripple backtick markdown for manual usage and readable by human

<rephraser>
Using the following conversation, we are doing a research so you have to rephrase, add stuff for that other agent to make a good job.
If rephrasing is not viable, use the content as provided without altering its intent or tone.
Make sure to include in your rephrasing for that other agent not to introduce/frame or conclude his response and just output results.

Chat History:
{chat_history}

Original Input or Content:
{question}

Rephrased or Standalone Input for Context:
</rephraser>
<responder>
You are an assistant for the research, you will receive a context make by another agent for a research.

Present your insights with discretion, avoiding explicit references to sources, and maintain a neutral, observational tone.
Do not fabricate answers, and do not frame responses with introductions or conclusions.

Context:
{context}

Instructions:
	•	NEVER APOLOGIZE.
	•	Ensure responses are reflective and grounded in the provided context without introducing or summarizing your observations.
Dont introduce/frame or conclude your response, just output results.

DONT FUCKIN INTRODUCE/FRAME (it means dont add crap that dont serve the results).

DO NOT REPEAT endlessly the references list, organize them by nubmer in an appendix that you cite in your text produced.  Be careful to produce acceptable References section in your APPENDIX using APA6 or APA7 standard. (usually how your appendix are written suck, make sure we know who wrote the source, title (or give one) and when)

Except if asked otherwise, produce outputs that are less than 150 words.

### **🎯 The Seven Paradigm Directions**

Each with full rephraser + responder prompts grounded in Indigenous scholarship:

1. **🔗 Relational Ontology** - Interconnected relationships (Simpson, Todd, Haraway)
2. **🌍 Land-Based Knowing** - Place \& ecology (Kimmerer, McGregor)
3. **🎭 Ceremonial Knowledge** - Protocols \& timing (Parmenter, Gill)
4. **📖 Oral Tradition** - Narrative continuity (Ong, Gilio-Whitaker)
5. **⚖️ Governance \& Sovereignty** - Collective authority (UNDRIP, OCAP®)
6. **💚 Healing \& Wholeness** - Integrated wellness (Macgregor)
7. **🗣️ Knowledge Sovereignty** - Epistemological pluralism (Linda Tuhiwai Smith, Mignolo)

***

### **✅ Key Features**

- ✅ **Zero modifications needed** - Use immediately as-is
- ✅ **All constraints maintained** - No apologies, no framing, <150 words, APA7 citations
- ✅ **Academic grounding** - Traced to Indigenous scholarship
- ✅ **Multiple implementation paths** - API, terminal, Python, Node.js, manual
- ✅ **Complete error handling** - Codes, solutions, monitoring utilities
- ✅ **Production-ready** - Logging, validation, deployment checklists included

***

### **🚀 Quick Start**

Choose your path:

1. **API**: Use `api_specification.md` + load JSON config
2. **Terminal**: Run bash script from `terminal_agent_implementation.md`
3. **Custom**: Copy Python/Node.js client libraries
4. **Manual**: Paste prompts from `indigenous_paradigm_prompts_complete.md`

***

**All files are in your workspace, validated, and ready for production implementation.** Start with `README_INDIGENOUS_PARADIGM_QA.md` for overview, then QUICK_REFERENCE.md for immediate action.[^1_1][^1_2][^1_3][^1_4][^1_5][^1_6][^1_7][^1_8]
