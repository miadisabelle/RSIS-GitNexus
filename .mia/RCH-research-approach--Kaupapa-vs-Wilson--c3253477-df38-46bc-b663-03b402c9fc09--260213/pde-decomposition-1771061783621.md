# Prompt Decomposition

## Primary Intent

**Action:** Develop
**Target:** a grounded comparative framework
**Urgency:** persistent
**Confidence:** 100%

## Secondary Intents

1. **Compare** - Kaupapa Māori and Wilson's Research Is Ceremony approaches
2. **Identify** - best application areas for Indigenous AI research
3. **Clarify** - commonalities
4. **Clarify** - particularities
5. **Position** - epistemological-ontological-axiological-methodological aspects of each approach
6. **Inform** - Guillaume's potential Master's pathway _(implicit)_

## Action Stack

- [ ] Understand Kaupapa Māori methodology
- [ ] Understand Wilson's Research Is Ceremony methodology
- [ ] Understand the context of Indigenous AI research
- [ ] Research epistemological-ontological-axiological-methodological positioning for Kaupapa Māori (depends on: Understand Kaupapa Māori methodology)
- [ ] Research epistemological-ontological-axiological-methodological positioning for Wilson's Research Is Ceremony (depends on: Understand Wilson's Research Is Ceremony methodology)
- [ ] Analyze commonalities between the two approaches (depends on: Research epistemological-ontological-axiological-methodological positioning for Kaupapa Māori)
- [ ] Analyze particularities between the two approaches (depends on: Research epistemological-ontological-axiological-methodological positioning for Wilson's Research Is Ceremony)
- [ ] Determine best application areas for each methodology within Indigenous AI research (depends on: Analyze commonalities between the two approaches)
- [ ] Construct the comparative framework document, detailing commonalities, particularities, and positioning (depends on: Determine best application areas for each methodology within Indigenous AI research)
- [ ] Review the framework for clarity, accuracy, and applicability to Indigenous AI research (depends on: Construct the comparative framework document, detailing commonalities, particularities, and positioning)
- [ ] Clarify the specific needs for Guillaume's Master's pathway
- [ ] Assess how well the framework addresses Guillaume's Master's pathway needs (depends on: Review the framework for clarity, accuracy, and applicability to Indigenous AI research)

## Assumptions

- Kaupapa Māori and Wilson's Research Is Ceremony are established methodologies
- Indigenous AI research is a relevant field of application
- Guillaume's Master's pathway requires guidance on research methodologies
