## What Your Screenshots Reveal

**Current Prototype Analysis:**

**Graph Visualization System** - Force-directed network showing nodes (typed entities like "human", with properties like direction/south, creation dates) connected via typed relationships ("guides→") with confidence percentages. Dark theme, multi-colored node categorization.

**Medicine Wheel Structure** - Four cardinal directions (East/Waabinong/Act 1, South/Zhaawanong/Act 2, West/Epangishmok/Act 3, North/Kiiwedinong/Act 4) with cultural naming conventions and seasonal symbolism (sunrise, sun, sunset, snowflake icons).

**Narrative Beats System** - Temporal event tracking across directions with dual view modes (Timeline chronological vs. By Direction categorical). Each beat has title, description, direction assignment, act number, and timestamp.

**Navigation Architecture** - Eight core modules: Medicine Wheel, Nodes, Relations, Ceremonies, Narrative, Beats, Cycles, Accountability.

**Missing Elements** - No visible RDF triple visualization, ontology browser/editor, ceremonial process workflows, cycle pattern recognition, or accountability relationship mapping.

## Expected Artifacts from Article Work

**Pre-Writing Required Artifacts:**

1. **Dual Ontological Framework Diagram**

1. Western: Entity-Attribute-Value model, hierarchical taxonomy, objective truth claims
2. Indigenous: Relational-Contextual-Reciprocal model, circular/cyclical knowledge, accountable knowing (Wilson's "relational accountability")



2. **Epistemological Bridge Model**

1. How RDF's subject-predicate-object maps to relationality
2. Where Western graph theory diverges from Indigenous circular knowing
3. Translation layer specifications



3. **Abstract Architecture Specification**

1. Ontological data representation layer (triple store + ceremonial context)
2. Transformation pipeline (Western RDF ↔ Indigenous relational patterns)
3. Visualization engine requirements (force graph + medicine wheel overlay)
4. Interaction patterns (query vs. ceremony-based discovery)



4. **GitHub Repository Comparative Matrix**

1. 3 repos analyzed across: data model extensibility, visualization flexibility, cultural adaptability, ceremony integration potential, license compatibility
2. Abstract parent class/interface definition they'd inherit from
3. Extension points for Indigenous knowledge protocols



5. **Methodological Framework Diagram**

1. Creative practice research cycle
2. How tool development documents/teaches Indigenous ways of knowing
3. Reflexive learning loops



6. **Research Questions Visual Map** (2-5 questions clustered around):

1. Ontological representation challenges
2. Epistemological fidelity in translation
3. Technical architecture decisions
4. Cultural protocol implementation



7. **Future Research Topology**

1. Areas requiring deeper investigation
2. Community validation processes
3. Scalability considerations
4. Interoperability with other knowledge systems

## Strategic Value of Withholding Results

By not showing me the article, you ensure I'm:

- Thinking from the visual/structural evidence in screenshots
- Inferring theoretical depth from UI patterns
- Proposing generative questions rather than reacting to answers
- Building independent understanding that can cross-validate the article's claims


This creates two knowledge paths that should converge, strengthening both.
