# Q1:  "Transform Indigenous research/ceremonial practice itself (methods, protocols, paradigms)" AND "Design and build media/AI/storytelling systems grounded in Indigenous paradigms".

Q2:  "Non‑negotiable: Indigenous methodologies‑centred programme  "

Q3: "Community-based/ceremonial work and knowledge stewardship" AND "Industry/innovation (AI, media, creative technology)"

Kaupapa Māori research approach – core features and uses

Kaupapa Māori emerged as a specifically Māori response to colonising research and policy, articulated most prominently by Linda Tuhiwai Smith in *Decolonizing Methodologies* and subsequent work. It is not just “a method”, but a critical, decolonising framework whereby research is by Māori, with Māori, for Māori, grounded in Māori language, tikanga, and aspirations for tino rangatiratanga. Research is positioned within te ao Māori: whakapapa, whanaungatanga, mana, tapu, utu, wairua, and manaakitanga become core organising principles, not “cultural add‑ons”.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

Smith and others frame Kaupapa Māori as:

- Epistemic: mātauranga Māori is a valid, sovereign knowledge system, not a “data source” for Western theory.[^2][^1]
- Political: research must contribute to Māori self‑determination and resist deficit/framing Māori as “problems”.[^5][^1]
- Methodological: research design, data collection and analysis are guided by tikanga and relational ethics (aroha, whanaungatanga, manaakitanga, kia tūpato, etc.).[^3][^4]
- Structural: Māori participation and control at all stages – from defining questions to dissemination and benefit‑sharing.[^4][^3]

Applied studies show what this looks like in practice. Health projects such as the Pukapuka Hauora asthma study with Māori parents, kaumātua wellbeing interventions, and tāngata kāpō (blind and low‑vision Māori) self‑determination initiatives were all designed as Kaupapa Māori – long‑term relational recruitment via whānau and marae, iterative in‑depth kōrero, and analysis framed through Māori concepts of wellbeing rather than generic biomedical metrics. Social research on Māori precarity, Māori health workforces and Māori perspectives on public accountability similarly use Kaupapa Māori to centre whanaungatanga, co‑design and accountability to iwi, hapū, and kāinga.[^6][^7][^8][^9][^4][^5]

In short, Kaupapa Māori is a specifically Aotearoa Māori, decolonial, praxis‑oriented framework. It is strongest where:

- The community, kaupapa, and primary epistemic frame are Māori.
- The project aims at concrete transformation in Māori health, education, media, housing, labour, environmental governance, etc.[^10][^5]
- Māori institutional formations (wānanga, iwi organisations, marae collectives, Māori faculties) hold real authority in the research.

Shawn Wilson’s *Research Is Ceremony* – core features and uses

Shawn Wilson’s *Research Is Ceremony: Indigenous Research Methods* articulates an Indigenous research paradigm whose central axiom is relationality: “we are our relationships” and “research is ceremony”. Where Kaupapa Māori is anchored in te ao Māori, Wilson offers a more pan‑Indigenous paradigm drawn from Cree experience and conversations with Indigenous scholars in Canada and Australia.[^11][^12]

Key elements:

- Ontology – reality is relationships: between people, land, ancestors, ideas, animals, spirits, future generations.[^12][^11]
- Epistemology – knowing is participating in those relationships; knowledge is not “owned” but held in trust within webs of relation.[^13][^12]
- Axiology – ethics are about maintaining harmonious, respectful, reciprocal relationships (respect, reciprocity, responsibility).[^13]
- Methodology – research designs must express and protect those relationships; questions, methods, analysis and writing are all accountable to the relationships they affect.[^11][^12]

Wilson develops the idea of “relational accountability”: the researcher is accountable to all their relations, including the community, the land, the knowledge itself, and even the ideas they work with. “Method” is secondary; any method (interviews, narrative, quantitative) can be used if it does not violate relational accountability. Ceremony is not just a metaphor: ethics, data collection, analysis, and dissemination are part of a living ceremonial process that keeps relationships in balance.[^12][^13]

The book is itself written as ceremony – as letters to his sons, embedded stories, and shifting narrative voice – modelling how Indigenous research products can break away from detached academic voice while still being rigorous. Subsequent Indigenous methodologies literature cites Wilson extensively as a key reference for relational accountability and ceremony‑as‑research in health, education, environmental governance and arts‑based work.[^14][^15][^11][^12]

Wilson’s paradigm is strongest where:

- The core concern is how to conduct research as a living ceremony, in accountable relation to community, land and ancestors.
- The project crosses multiple Indigenous and non‑Indigenous contexts (e.g. international, pan‑Indigenous, transdisciplinary) and needs a relational rather than nation‑specific anchor.
- The medium itself is relational or processual: land‑based education, community co‑design, digital storytelling, participatory tech design, etc.[^14]

Commonalities between Kaupapa Māori and Wilson

Substantive overlap is high; in practice, many Māori scholars implicitly work in both frames. Shared commitments include:

- Indigenous paradigm first: both insist that ontology, epistemology, axiology, and methodology come from Indigenous world views, not just “Indigenised methods” bolted onto Western designs.[^1][^12]
- Decolonising purpose: both respond directly to extractive, racist research histories. Research must benefit Indigenous peoples, restore control over knowledge, and resist deficit framings.[^3][^14][^1]
- Relational ethics: Kaupapa Māori ethics (aroha, manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, kia tūpato) and Wilson’s relational accountability (respect, reciprocity, responsibility) converge on relationship‑first ethics.[^4][^13]
- Community control and benefit: both emphasise Indigenous participation in defining questions, methods, analysis and dissemination, and insist that research should strengthen community capacity and self‑determination.[^9][^10][^3]
- Flexibility of methods: neither prescribes fixed techniques; interviews, hui, pūrākau/storywork, surveys, or even mixed‑methods designs are acceptable as long as they serve the paradigm and relationships.[^16][^6][^14]

So philosophically, Wilson’s paradigm and Kaupapa Māori sit in the same “family”: they are compatible and in many projects can and do operate together.

Key differences / particularities

1. Scope and location

- Kaupapa Māori is intentionally specific to Māori contexts in Aotearoa. It is tied to te reo, whakapapa, iwi/hapū structures, Treaty histories, and local struggles over education, health, justice and land.[^2][^1]
- Wilson’s paradigm is trans‑local and more generically “Indigenous”, built from Cree experience but explicitly framed as a paradigm that Indigenous scholars in Canada and Australia recognise themselves in. It is more easily exported across Indigenous nations where local political projects differ but relationality is shared.[^12]

Implication:
For a Waikato‑based project with Māori communities, Kaupapa Māori is non‑optional and should be primary; Wilson helps articulate and deepen the philosophical grounding and can become the language you use when connecting your work to broader Indigenous conversations beyond Aotearoa.

2. Political edge vs metaphysical articulation

- Kaupapa Māori, particularly in Smith’s work, is sharply political: colonisation, imperialism, knowledge as a tool of domination, and research as part of Māori struggles for tino rangatiratanga.[^1]
- Wilson foregrounds the metaphysics and ethics of relationality and ceremony more than the institutional politics of decolonisation; colonial critique is present, but less the central organising thread than “all my relations”.[^11][^12]

Implication:
If a thesis must directly theorise and intervene in education policy, health systems, extractive data regimes, or state law in Aotearoa, Kaupapa Māori gives you sharper tools for critiquing and redesigning institutions. Wilson is especially powerful when articulating the philosophical basis of why research and design must be ceremonial and relational – ideal when you’re building new systems or practices and want to ground them ontologically.

3. Methodological elaboration vs paradigm narrative

- Kaupapa Māori literature has accumulated detailed methodological principles (whanaungatanga, manaakitanga, koha, kanohi kitea, mā te Māori etc.) that are concrete enough to operationalise in ethics protocols, recruitment, data collection and analysis.[^17][^3][^4]
- *Research Is Ceremony* offers fewer “checklists” and more narrative exemplars of practicing relational accountability; it is less of a procedural manual, more of a paradigm‑shifting conversation.[^15][^11]

Implication:
For ethics applications, university risk committees, and multi‑stakeholder MoUs, Kaupapa Māori’s principle sets and precedents in health, education and social research are tactically useful. Wilson’s work is invaluable to keep the ceremony alive – preventing the paradigm from being reduced to a tick‑box cultural‑safety framework.[^7][^10][^6]

4. Nation‑specific tikanga vs cross‑context AI/media applications

For AI/media/storytelling systems:

- Kaupapa Māori can specify precisely how data classification, interface design, narrative structures and governance should embed tikanga, whakapapa relations and Te Tiriti commitments in Aotearoa.[^18][^14]
- Wilson’s paradigm can guide how AI systems more generally (across nations) should enact relational accountability – for example, how an AI “agent” participates in ceremony, how it is accountable to communities, how it “returns” benefits, and how code itself is part of a ceremonial process.

Which research subjects each approach fits best (for your orientation)

Given your stated aims:

- Q1: Transform Indigenous research/ceremonial practice AND design media/AI/storytelling systems grounded in Indigenous paradigms.
- Q2: Non‑negotiable: Indigenous methodologies‑centred programme.
- Q3: Community‑based/ceremonial work AND industry/innovation (AI, media, creative technology).

A useful mapping:

- Kaupapa Māori primary frame for:
    - Māori‑centred research on AI, media and storytelling that is accountable to iwi/hapū/whānau – e.g. Māori narrative AI agents, digital marae spaces, Kaupapa Māori evaluation of existing media/AI systems.[^18][^3]
    - Projects where institutional structures (universities, health boards, councils, media platforms) in Aotearoa must be critiqued and reshaped.
    - Work explicitly under Waikato’s Te Pua Wānanga ki te Ao, Māori and Indigenous Studies, marae‑based research, and Māori Media \& Communication.
- Wilson’s *Research Is Ceremony* as co‑frame for:
    - Conceptualising your whole research system as ceremony: supervisory relationships, AI toolchains, data pipelines, evaluation processes as parts of one ceremony of relational accountability.
    - Multi‑community or trans‑Indigenous AI/storytelling projects (e.g. systems that must hold Cree, Māori, and Pacific relations together without flattening them).
    - Writing and designing the interaction with AI as letters, stories, protocols of ceremony rather than only “methods sections”.

In practice, for your thesis/theses:

- Use Kaupapa Māori to anchor commitments, ethics, governance, and specific Māori methodological choices at Waikato.
- Use Wilson’s paradigm to articulate your meta‑architecture: research as ceremony; AI/media systems as participants in, and facilitators of, that ceremony.

Mapping to Waikato master’s pathways

From your list, the relevant high‑level families at Waikato are:

- Arts Masters (e.g. MA in Māori and Indigenous Studies, Theatre Studies, Music, etc.).[^19][^20][^21]
- Media and Creative Technologies Masters (MMCT).[^22][^23][^24][^25]
- Design Masters (MDes).[^26][^27][^28]
- Engineering Masters (ME).[^29][^30][^31]
- Science and Technologies Masters (MSc and related).[^32][^33][^34]

Given Q2 (non‑negotiable Indigenous methodologies‑centred), the two strongest anchors are:

1. Master of Arts (Māori and Indigenous Studies) – Arts Masters

- Housed in Te Pua Wānanga ki te Ao – Faculty of Māori \& Indigenous Studies; explicitly about Māori culture, language, knowledge and their role in Aotearoa’s social, economic, political life.[^20][^35][^19]
- Explicitly connects Māori Studies to global Indigenous Studies, including struggles like Standing Rock, Indigenous environmental justice, and decolonising movements.[^35][^19]
- Offers a MA‑level thesis path where Kaupapa Māori, whakapapa methodology, pūrākau, wānanga‑based and other Indigenous approaches are normative, not “special topics”.[^17][^10]
- Career trajectories: research consultant, Māori creative and performing arts, iwi development, broadcasting/journalism, policy analysis, international development – all framed through Indigenous leadership.[^36][^35]

For you, this is the natural place to:

- Do a deep thesis on Indigenous research paradigms: Kaupapa Māori, Wilson, Kovach, Chilisa, Two‑Eyed Seeing, etc., and articulate your own ceremony‑aware methodology for AI and narrative systems.
- Anchor your ceremonial and methodological work in Waikato’s Māori and Indigenous Studies community, with supervisors whose default paradigm is Kaupapa Māori.[^37][^20]

2. Master of Media and Creative Technologies (MMCT) – Media and Creative Technologies Masters

- 1‑year degree focusing on Screen and Media Studies, with subjects including Creative Practices, Creative Technologies, Screen and Media Studies, and Māori Media and Communication.[^23][^25][^22]
- Explicitly invites AI, VR, online content, podcasts, multimedia installations as core creative research media; you work under supervision to produce a portfolio of audio‑visual projects plus methodological/theoretical framing.[^22][^23]
- Has a Māori Media and Communication track offered under the Faculty of Māori and Indigenous Studies, which is a key hinge between Kaupapa Māori and media/tech practice.[^20][^23]
- Career trajectories: media producer, digital content creator, VR/AI designer, multimedia artist, creative business owner, journalist, producer, social media manager, etc.[^38][^39][^23]

For you, MMCT (especially with Māori Media \& Communication, or Creative Technologies + Māori supervision) is the place to:

- Build actual AI‑mediated storytelling systems, media installations, narrative platforms, or ceremonial AI tools.
- Embed the methodological work from the MA into concrete creative technologies, with a year‑long supervised project that can be both practice‑led and research‑driven.[^25][^22]

3. Master of Design (MDes) – Design Masters

- Focuses on design theory, technology and original design research; aim is to specialise in a chosen design/creative‑practices area and execute a large‑scale design research project.[^27][^28][^26]
- Strong on design methods, conceptual design, UX, interaction and visual/experience design; provides a home for exploring design‑thinking, service design, etc. in depth.[^40][^41][^27]
- Career trajectories: interaction designer, multimedia specialist, design educator, creative entrepreneur, UI/UX researcher.[^28][^27]

For you, MDes is a potential third step / adjunct where the question becomes: how to design ceremony‑aware interfaces, workflows, and service ecosystems for Indigenous‑centred AI and media tools. It will likely be less explicitly Indigenous‑methodology‑centred than the MA, but you can carry that into your topic and seek sympathetic supervisors.

4. Master of Engineering (ME) and Master of Science (MSc) – Engineering / Science \& Technologies Masters

- ME is a research‑focused 12‑month degree aimed at solving an engineering question; strong in mechanical, civil, environmental, electronic, mechatronics, robotics, etc., with some software engineering via Computer Science.[^30][^31][^29]
- MSc is flexible across biological, environmental, computing, math, etc., with a mix of taught papers and a research project or dissertation.[^33][^34][^32]

These are excellent for heavy technical work (e.g. core ML, robotics, signal processing, scientific computing). But:

- Indigenous methodologies are not central to the programmes; you would be “carrying” Kaupapa Māori and Wilson into contexts where supervisors and cohorts are mostly operating under conventional scientific/engineering paradigms.[^42][^33]
- For your non‑negotiable Q2, they are better as later or parallel technical depth add‑ons, once you have secured an Indigenous methodologies home base in Māori \& Indigenous Studies and/or MMCT.

5. Arts Masters in performance (Music/Theatre Studies)

- Postgraduate music and theatre at Gallagher Academy emphasise practice‑led performance, creative work, and critical reflection, with strong facilities and staff active as performers/composers.[^43][^44][^45][^46]
- They could host ceremony‑infused performance, theatre, or sonic art projects related to your AI/storytelling work, but Indigenous research methodology is not inherently the organising frame.

These could become collaborators or secondary enrolments – for example, a co‑supervised project between Māori \& Indigenous Studies and Theatre or Music, with performance as part of a ceremony‑centred research design.

Concrete programme configurations for your goals

Given your Q1–Q3, a realistic configuration at Waikato that respects your constraints:

1. Core methodological home: MA in Māori and Indigenous Studies (Arts Masters)

- Primary thesis: development of an Indigenous methodology for AI and narrative systems rooted in Kaupapa Māori and Wilson’s research‑as‑ceremony paradigm.
- Subject matter:
    - Comparative analysis of Kaupapa Māori, *Research Is Ceremony*, and related paradigms (Kovach, Chilisa, Two‑Eyed Seeing, etc.) in relation to algorithmic systems and media ecologies.
    - Design of a ceremony‑aware research protocol and governance framework for AI‑mediated narrative work with Māori and pan‑Indigenous partners.
- Outputs: written thesis, possibly with practice‑based components (e.g. prototype protocols, story cycles, ceremonial interaction scripts).

Kaupapa Māori is primary methodology; Wilson provides the relational/ceremonial meta‑architecture. This directly addresses your wish to transform Indigenous research/ceremonial practice.

2. Applied creative‑tech home: MMCT (Media and Creative Technologies Masters), preferably with Māori Media and Communication or Creative Technologies focus

- Major creative research project: AI‑assisted storytelling systems, interactive ceremonial media, or narrative AI agents co‑designed with Māori communities.
- Methods: practice‑led research, prototyping, iterative co‑design, with Kaupapa Māori and Wilson’s relational accountability embedded as your methodological frame (brought in from your MA work).[^23][^22]
- Outputs: portfolio of audio‑visual/digital works (e.g. short films, VR/AR experiences, AI‑driven interactions), with critical exegesis that explicitly argues for research as ceremony.

This satisfies your drive toward AI/media/creative technology and supports Q3’s industry/innovation pathway, while still allowing Indigenous‑centred supervision, especially if you anchor in Māori Media \& Communication.[^20][^23]

3. Optional third vector: Master of Design as a specialised design‑research layer

If you want to go further into the design of tools, interfaces and services that operationalise your methodology (e.g. ceremony‑aware research management tools, AI orchestration dashboards grounded in whakapapa, or design systems for Indigenous‑centred media labs), MDes offers the design‑research frame to do that.[^26][^27][^28]

In that case:

- MA (Māori \& Indigenous Studies) – paradigm and protocols.
- MMCT – media/AI/story implementation and creative research.
- MDes – design of reusable, shareable design frameworks and artefacts.

Engineering or Science Masters become optional later bolt‑ons if you decide you need deep hardcore ML/engineering credentialing; they are not ideal first homes given Q2.

Programme‑selection logic mapped back to Kaupapa Māori vs Wilson

- MA in Māori \& Indigenous Studies:
    - Dominated by Kaupapa Māori and related Māori methodologies; this is where you root yourself in local tikanga, iwi/hapū relationships, Māori political projects, and institutional decolonisation work at Waikato.[^37][^17][^20]
    - Wilson’s *Research Is Ceremony* here functions as one of your key theoretical texts, especially for articulating research as ceremony, relational accountability, and your own position within multiple Indigenous and technological relationships.[^11][^12]
- MMCT (with Māori Media and Communication / Creative Technologies):
    - Kaupapa Māori shapes your obligations to Māori media ecologies, representation, narrative sovereignty, and data/creative governance.[^18][^3]
    - Wilson’s paradigm shapes how your project behaves as ceremony: the way the AI or media system participates in relationships, the way collaborations and exhibitions are structured, how feedback loops are treated as ongoing ceremony rather than one‑off “user testing”.[^14][^13]
- Optional MDes:
    - Kaupapa Māori constrains and inspires your design ethics, ensuring that design decisions uphold mana, whakapapa and whanaungatanga.
    - Wilson’s paradigm guides you to see design processes themselves as ceremony – where iteration is not just optimisation but re‑entering and deepening relationships with people, land and code.

This combination satisfies:

- Q1’s dual aim (transform Indigenous research/ceremony and build media/AI/story systems).
- Q2’s requirement for an Indigenous methodologies‑centred core (MA Māori \& Indigenous Studies, plus Māori Media \& Communication as subject option in MMCT).
- Q3’s hybrid future (community‑based/ceremonial stewardship via Māori \& Indigenous Studies; industry/innovation via MMCT and possibly MDes).

If you want, the next step can be to sketch 2–3 concrete thesis titles and project bundles (e.g. “bundle A = MA+MMCT in parallel, bundle B = sequential, bundle C = MA+MMCT+MDes”) with workload and time implications laid out explicitly.
