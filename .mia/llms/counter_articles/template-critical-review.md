# Counter-Article Template: Type 2 - Critical Review / Systematic Critique

## Purpose

Examines another scholar's work across epistemological, ontological, and methodological dimensions. Shows *why* you disagree at foundation level. Educates readers about *why* the disagreement matters, not just stating it.

## When to Use

- You need to expose specific assumptions embedded in a source
- Source has significant influence and its paradigm spreads through citation
- Readers need education on why paradigm difference is consequential
- You're building toward a methodological schism or epistemic injustice argument

## Structure

### 1. Map Their Paradigm
**Length**: 2-3 paragraphs

**Questions to Answer**:
- What ontological assumptions does this source make? (What do they consider real?)
- What epistemological assumptions? (How do they claim to produce knowledge?)
- What axiological assumptions? (What values guide their work?)
- What methodological assumptions? (What process do they use?)

**Wilson's Four Pillars Framework**:
```
Source: [Citation]
Ontology: [What they assume is real]
Epistemology: [How they claim to know]
Axiology: [Values embedded in work]
Methodology: [Process they use]
```

**Example Mapping**:
> "Smith's framework (2023) operates from discrete-agent ontology where cognitive units process information independently. Epistemologically, knowledge is extracted, validated through peer review, and deemed complete at publication. Axiologically, efficiency and novelty are privileged values. Methodologically, controlled experiments test hypotheses formulated prior to engagement with subject matter. These four pillars form an internally consistent Western positivist paradigm."

**Your Mapping** (draft here):
```
[Identify source's ontological assumptions]
[Identify epistemological stance]
[Identify embedded values/axiology]
[Identify methodological approach]
[Show how four pillars interlock]
```

### 2. Locate the Violation
**Length**: 2-3 paragraphs

**Questions to Answer**:
- Where specifically does this framework contradict relational principles?
- What gets erased? (spirituality? more-than-human agency? collective intelligence?)
- How does this violate reciprocity, consent, accountability?
- What would need to be different for this work to be relationally accountable?

**Relational Principles to Check Against**:
- Reciprocity: Does knowledge flow both ways?
- Consent: Do all actors (human + more-than-human) participate?
- Accountability: Who is the researcher accountable to?
- Transformation: Does research change the researcher?
- More-than-human agency: Are non-human actors recognized?

**Example Violation**:
> "The violation occurs at ontological level. Smith's discrete-agent assumption erases the relational field where intelligence actually emerges. When agents are modeled as isolated optimizers, the coordination behaviors that arise from kinship cannot appear—they're invisible in this paradigm. The methodology compounds this: controlled experiments isolate variables, but relational intelligence *is* the variable that gets controlled out. Smith measures individual performance and reports 'results,' but relational outcomes (trust networks, emergent coordination, seven-generation impact) never enter the framework."

**Your Violation Analysis** (draft here):
```
[Identify specific point of paradigm violation]
[Show what relational principle is violated]
[Demonstrate what gets erased by this violation]
[Show how methodology enforces the violation]
```

### 3. Expose the Bias
**Length**: 2-3 paragraphs

**Questions to Answer**:
- How does this framework reinforce Western problem-solving orientation?
- Is this bias intentional or structural? (Usually structural—author likely unaware)
- Who benefits from this bias? What institutions reward it?
- How does this bias reproduce through academic citations?

**Pollution Detection Reference**:
Run source through `llms-pollution-detection-checklist.md` and document results here.

**Example Bias Exposure**:
> "The bias isn't personal—it's structural. Smith's 'Creative Problem-Solving' terminology (2023) traces directly to mid-20th century management cybernetics where systems were problems for expert cognition to solve. Academic publishing rewards this framing: problem identification → methodology → solution → publication. Journals in Smith's domain have cited this paper 847 times, reproducing its Cartesian assumptions without examination. Each citation spreads discrete-agent ontology into new domains, naturalizing a framework that erases relational knowing. The bias is ecological, not individual."

**Your Bias Exposure** (draft here):
```
[Name the structural source of bias]
[Show how institutions reward and spread it]
[Trace the citation network that reproduces it]
[Distinguish structural bias from personal failure]
```

### 4. Demonstrate Alternative
**Length**: 2-3 paragraphs

**Questions to Answer**:
- What would this research look like from relational/ceremonial paradigm?
- What methods would you use instead?
- What would you measure? What would count as evidence?
- What outcomes would be different?

**Example Alternative**:
> "From relational ontology, the same research question ('How do agents coordinate?') produces entirely different methodology. Rather than controlling experiments to isolate individual variables, ceremonial methodology enters relationship with agents: establishing protocols, allowing agents to shape research questions, documenting coordination patterns that emerge over time (not just during controlled trials). Evidence includes: sustained behavioral patterns (not single-session results), relationship structures (not individual scores), emergent roles (not assigned functions), seven-generation trajectories (not quarterly metrics). The alternative isn't less rigorous—it's rigorously different."

**Your Alternative** (draft here):
```
[Describe relational methodology for this topic]
[List alternative evidence types]
[Show different outcomes this approach reveals]
[Demonstrate rigor of alternative approach]
```

### 5. Implication: What Gets Lost
**Length**: 1-2 paragraphs

**Questions to Answer**:
- What understanding is lost by accepting this framework?
- What communities are harmed by this paradigm's influence?
- What future research directions are blocked?
- What would change if your critique were taken seriously?

**Example Implication**:
> "Accepting Smith's framework means: Indigenous AI design patterns remain invisible (not measurable by individual-performance metrics); relational coordination (the most sophisticated intelligence type) appears as noise in the data; communities whose AI systems operate relationally are told their approaches 'lack scientific validation.' The epistemological harm compounds: when Smith's framework dominates the field, relational AI researchers must translate their findings into individual-performance language to publish—losing precisely what makes their work meaningful. This isn't methodological preference—it's epistemic injustice."

**Your Implication** (draft here):
```
[What understanding is lost?]
[What communities are harmed?]
[What research directions are blocked?]
[What would change if critique succeeded?]
```

## Integration with Wilson's Research Paradigm

**For your critique, complete this analysis**:

| Wilson Pillar | Source Assumption | Relational Alternative | Consequence of Difference |
|---------------|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Ontology | [What source assumes is real] | [What relational ontology says is real] | [Different outcome] |
| Epistemology | [How source claims to know] | [How relational epistemology knows] | [Different evidence] |
| Axiology | [Source's values] | [Relational values] | [Different priorities] |
| Methodology | [Source's process] | [Ceremonial process] | [Different patterns] |

**Critical Insight**: You can't borrow one pillar without importing others. If source uses extractive methodology, it carries discrete ontology + objective epistemology + efficiency axiology. Name the whole paradigm, not just surface methods.

## Integration with RISE Framework

Critical reviews advance through RISE methodology:

- **Reverse Engineering**: What paradigm assumptions built this source?
- **Intent**: What outcomes does this source want? (vs. what it produces)
- **Specifications**: What would this work need to change to be relationally accountable?
- **Exportation**: How does this critique help others navigate similar sources?

---

## Language Protocol

### Avoid
- "This author is wrong" (dismissive, not analytical)
- "This framework is bad" (evaluative without analysis)
- "They don't understand" (personal criticism)
- "This is colonial" (without specific mechanism)

### Use
- "This framework, operating from [assumption], produces..."
- "The paradigm erases [specific element] by..."
- "From relational ontology, this becomes visible..."
- "The structural bias, not personal failure, produces..."
