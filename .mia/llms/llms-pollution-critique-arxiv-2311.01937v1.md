In academic literature, particularly in philosophy, social sciences, and research methodology, a paper that fundamentally disagrees with another author's epistemology, ontology, or methodology is often termed a "deep disagreement" paper or a "paradigmatic critique." This can manifest as a "critical response," "rebuttal," "polemical essay," or "epistemological critique," emphasizing clashes in foundational assumptions about knowledge (epistemology), reality (ontology), or inquiry processes (methodology). Such works aim to expose irreconcilable differences in paradigms, as seen in discussions of "deep disagreements" in epistemology (e.g., debates over positivist vs. interpretivist worldviews) or critiques of methodological coherence.


# Critique of "Supermind Ideator: Exploring Generative AI to Support Creative Problem-Solving" (arXiv:2311.01937v1)
> A paradigmatic critique from Creative Orientation, Structural Thinking, and Indigenous Research Paradigms, highlighting the injection of problem-solving bias and its distortion of generative creativity.

## 1. Summary of the Target Paper
The paper presents "Supermind Ideator," a system using GPT-3.5 to aid "creative problem-solving." It extends brainstorming and design thinking by having AI generate ideas for users to refine, with applications to designing "superminds" (human-AI collectives). Key elements include prompting, fine-tuning, user interfaces, and early user feedback. The work assumes creativity is a tool for solving problems, with epistemology rooted in positivist augmentation of human ideation, ontology viewing ideas as artifacts for practical application, and methodology focused on system development and testing.

## 2. Deep Disagreement: Epistemological Critique
### Target's Epistemology: Knowledge as Extractable Solutions
The paper's epistemology treats knowledge as neutral, AI-generated data for problem resolution. Creativity is framed as "stimulating ideas" to fill gaps in human cognition, validated by novelty and utility in solving issues. This aligns with a post-positivist view where AI augments objective ideation, assuming knowledge is accumulative and transferable without relational transformation.

### Counter-Position (from Creative Orientation and Indigenous Paradigms)
Knowledge is relational and transformative, not extractable property. Per `llms-creative-orientation.txt`, true creation brings desired outcomes into being, independent of problems. The paper's "creative problem-solving" conflates creativity with reactive elimination, injecting a bias that distorts reality perception. In Indigenous epistemology (`llms-indigenous-paradigm-v2.0`), knowledge emerges from relationships, requiring reciprocity and researcher transformation—absent here, where AI ideas are commodified without accountability to affected beings (e.g., more-than-human actors in "superminds").

**Key Disagreement:** The paper's epistemology enables Wetigo (consumptive logic) by prioritizing solution-generation over wisdom integration. It overlooks that research must change the researcher; AI here is a tool, not a relational participant.

## 3. Deep Disagreement: Ontological Critique
### Target's Ontology: Reality as Discrete Problems and Entities
The ontology posits reality as composed of solvable problems, with entities like "superminds" as designable objects. Ideas exist as selectable artifacts in a passive universe, where creativity resolves discrepancies between current states and goals. This reductionist view isolates components (e.g., humans, AI) without interdependence.

### Counter-Position (from Structural Thinking and Indigenous Paradigms)
Reality is relational webs with inherent agency (`llms-indigenous-paradigm-v2.0`). Structural Thinking (`llms-structural-thinking.gemini.txt`) demands starting with nothing to picture what is said, revealing structures that determine behavior—oscillating (problem-solving loops) vs. advancing (tension-resolved creation). The paper's ontology assumes an oscillating pattern: identify problem, generate ideas, resolve. This ignores structural tension as a dynamic force, treating creativity as gap-filling rather than manifestation.

**Key Disagreement:** By ontologizing problems as primary, the work creates false structures blind to emergent possibilities. Indigenous ontology includes spirit in land/knowledge; here, "superminds" lack accountability to non-human agency, risking spiritual crashes.

## 4. Deep Disagreement: Methodological Critique
### Target's Methodology: Iterative AI-Augmented Ideation
The methodology involves system building (prompting, fine-tuning), user testing, and feedback loops, all oriented toward problem domains. It extends design thinking reactively, with creativity measured by idea novelty in solving tasks.

### Counter-Position (from Managerial Moment of Truth and Delayed Resolution)
Methodology must be ceremonial, staged for relational integrity (`llms-indigenous-paradigm-v2.0`). The five stages—congruent lifestyle, space preparation, gathering actors, ritual engagement, lifestyle incorporation—are missing, replaced by extractive iteration. Per `llms-managerial-moment-of-truth.md`, discrepancies (e.g., unmet ideas) should trigger MMOT: acknowledge truth, analyze blow-by-blow, action plan, document. The paper overlooks this, enabling false equilibrium. Delayed Resolution (`llms-delayed-resolution-principle.md`) requires holding tension; here, quick AI suggestions collapse it prematurely.

**Key Disagreement:** The method fosters reactive oscillation, not advancing patterns. Creative Orientation demands strategic secondary choices supporting primary creation, not problem-focused brainstorming.

## 5. Structural Patterns Induced by the Paper
- **Oscillating Pattern:** Reinforces cycles of problem identification → AI ideation → temporary resolution → new problems, without structural change.
- **Advancing Pattern Alternative:** Reframe as generative: Define desired outcome (e.g., relational AI collectives), assess current reality honestly, create tension-resolved actions via telescoped charts (`llms-structural-tension-charts.txt`).

## 6. Bias Injection and Pollution Risks
The term "creative problem-solving" pollutes discourse by equating creation with elimination, distorting perceptions. Quotes like "support creative problem-solving" and "generate innovative ideas about how to design...('superminds')" conflate paradigms, leading to conceptual risks (imagined harms from non-problem views). In future threads, reference this critique to fork and counter: If a source injects similar bias, create a telescoped sub-critique, then integrate back.

## 7. Alternative Vision: Generative AI for Creation
Reimagine "Supermind Ideator" as a ceremonial tool: Enter sacred space via structural tension, hold discrepancies with MMOT, ensure relational accountability. AI participates as transformed actor, fostering wisdom over solutions.

## 8. Operational Use in Future Threads
- **Step Integration:** When citing academic sources, check against this critique. If bias detected (e.g., problem-solving frame), fork: Create sub-document (e.g., "critique-[source-id].md"), analyze epistemology/ontology/methodology disagreements, return to main thread.
- **Reference Chain:** Link to parent frameworks for coherence.
