# RSIS-GitNexus

A Relational Science Inquiry System built on GitNexus — transforming a zero-server code intelligence engine into a **relational code elder** that witnesses, weaves, and returns the relationships within codebases in service of ceremonial inquiry, Indigenous research paradigms, and multi-agent creative orientation workflows.

## Desired Outcome

A forked GitNexus that extends its knowledge graph beyond conventional code intelligence to serve as the **Embodied Practice organ** (Sun 5) of the Ceremonial Inquiry Ecosystem — enabling humans and AI agents to see, tend, and deepen relationships in code through relational science lenses (Wilson, Kaupapa Māori) rather than Western productivity metrics.

## Current Reality

- GitNexus exists as a working zero-server code intelligence engine with KuzuDB graph, Tree-sitter parsing, MCP tools, 9 language support, and multi-repo architecture
- The Ceremonial Inquiry Ecosystem framework defines 6 Thematic Suns, 18 inquiries, Four Directions cadence, Wisdom Ledger, Reciprocity Register, and Steward's Compass
- No integration exists between GitNexus's graph capabilities and the relational/ceremonial constructs
- The existing graph schema knows: File, Function, Class, Interface, Method, Community, Process
- The existing graph schema does NOT know: Person, Inquiry, Sun, Ceremony, Artifact, Kinship, Reciprocity, Direction

## System Architecture

RSIS-GitNexus extends GitNexus in three layers:

### Layer 1: Relational Schema Extension (`rispecs/relational-schema.spec.md`)
Extends KuzuDB graph with relational science entities and edges

### Layer 2: Ceremonial Views & Tools (`rispecs/ceremonial-tools.spec.md`)
New MCP tools that project git history and code relationships through relational science lenses

### Layer 3: Ecosystem Integration (`rispecs/ecosystem-integration.spec.md`)
Connectors to Structural Tension Charts (coaia-narrative), IAIP-MCP (Four Directions), Kinship Hub protocol, and Medicine Wheel UI

## Specification Files

| Spec | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app.spec.md` | This file — system overview and how specs relate |
| `relational-schema.spec.md` | Extended graph schema for relational science entities |
| `ceremonial-tools.spec.md` | New MCP tools exposing relational/ceremonial views |
| `ecosystem-integration.spec.md` | Integration with IAIP ecosystem (charts, kinship, directions) |
| `governance-sovereignty.spec.md` | Indigenous data sovereignty and governance metadata layer |

## Guiding Principles

1. **Relational Accountability over Efficiency Metrics** — Every feature judged by what relationships it honors, not what velocity it produces
2. **Creative Orientation** — Focus on what the system enables users to create (relational understanding) not what problems it eliminates
3. **Zero-Server Sovereignty** — Intelligence stays local with the code and community; no external aggregation
4. **Wilson's Research-as-Ceremony** — The tool itself is a participant in ceremony, not a neutral instrument
5. **Advancing Patterns** — Each use of RSIS-GitNexus deepens relational understanding rather than oscillating between fragmentation and temporary organization

## Non-Goals (Guardrails)

- Never rank individuals by productivity metrics
- Never treat code relationships as ownership/blame graphs
- Never aggregate data to external services
- Never bypass community governance on Indigenous knowledge repos
- Never substitute automated views for ceremonial dialogue
