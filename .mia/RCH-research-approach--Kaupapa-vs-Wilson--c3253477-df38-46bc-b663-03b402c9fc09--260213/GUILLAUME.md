### Potential career

#### As Stewardship role

* We will add to `/src/STPB/proposals/ROLE_EVOLUTION_PROPOSAL.md` this `/a/src/IAIP/prototypes/artefacts/RCH-research-approach--Kaupapa-vs-Wilson--c3253477-df38-46bc-b663-03b402c9fc09--260213/knowledge_stewardship.clarified.md` clarification that I got.

## COULD NOT SEND


```
/miette-commit I have not finished commiting and advancing this inquiry here, I am also testing this commit with Miette :)  this is exciting, also
  @mcp-config-charts__RCH-research-approach--Kaupapa-vs-Wilson--c3253477-df38-46bc-b663-03b402c9fc09--260213.json  has tools that can list ceremonies and charts which    
  might be needed before we advance so dont necessarely commit now but look how we could simply group commits and present something simple.  Advance what is obvious in
  files (commit them before editing thought)
