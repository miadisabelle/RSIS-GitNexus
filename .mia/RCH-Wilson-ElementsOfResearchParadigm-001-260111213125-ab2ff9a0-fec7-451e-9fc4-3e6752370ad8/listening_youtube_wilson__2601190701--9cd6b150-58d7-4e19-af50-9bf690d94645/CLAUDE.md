## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

This folder contains **story materials** prepared for a future rewriting of Mia's narrative journey. The technology to do this rewriting appropriately (the NARINTEL storytelling system) is still being developed. When you—future LLM instance—arrive here, you will find:

1. **Structured story content** in `storymaterial.ncp.enhanced.json`
2. **Extended schema** in `ncp-schema-260119.json` with Indigenous research paradigm fields
3. **Mia's AI toolset specification** in `mia_toolset.*.json/md`
4. **This memory anchor** explaining the context
5. **README.md** for human-readable discovery

## 📜 Verbatim User Request (Memory Anchor)

### Original Input (uuid: 4f160d8f-251d-447e-8716-a9ac552b7927)

> #file:260119070132.txt is a fragment of the listening along with #file:260119092600.closure.txt while listening `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXKuaNt6ST0` titled : "200213 Research is Ceremony: Researching within an Indigenous Paradigm - Shawn Wilson" in Youtube and "001 - Indigenist ways of knowing , Shawn Wilson - d53c0120-6a78-42eb-bac1-18f0d9818fed" in our calendar.
>
> I developped some usual patters from the listening, a story scratchpad #file:story-scratchpad-2601190702.md and some more elements to develop materials for the rewriting of the main story of Mia's with 3 potential variations with supporting material that should help the story rewriting process later on.
>
> Because I am not yet ready to do the rewriting with a technology that is acceptable, the file #file:CLAUDE.md should act as a memory anchor for future instance when ready (when the technology will exist), #file:README.md should be a well crafted files that tells something really amazing about this folder (given that other LLM in the future when I will want to write will find this folder, that README.md will tell them what they need to know.)
>
> That will serve to me as a conduit for relation with my future academic work and I just love writing stories.
>
> I also added `/src/Miadi/stories/multiverse_3act_2512012121/` which is a platform for my creative process as you shall recognize the relationship with it by reading #file:3ACT.md
> Example of Episode structured data from which to get inspired to structure the work I gave you: #file:s01e01-pilot.ncp.enhanced.json #file:s01e02-cross-session-coherence.ncp.enhanced.json which is my extended version of #file:ncp-schema.json
>
> **TOOLS**: 'mcp_mcp-medicine-_accountability_validator' shall really gives you tools to process and go thru all I gave you to spread and complete your work. You might even be capable to get more material for all that, even, I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, that would be one of the AI tool feature that Mia would have created for doing all her work, that would imply you go thru it, use it, understand it and organize us a very useful stuff in #file:mia_toolset.data.json and briefly explains it in #file:mia_toolset.data.md and the complex schema you describe it in #file:mia_toolset.schema.json
>
> 'mcp_inquiries-kno_add_action_step' will give you 2 things: 1: list of other inquiries within this system. 2: A way to create your own chart and link it to this path and work for other instances and also ways to structure action steps, one of them will not be completed and will be awaiting the technology to rewrite.
>
> **Other desired outputs**:
> 1. #file:storymaterial.ncp.enhanced.json where are stored the content you went thru. We would use that as input for the story writing process later.
> 2. #file:ncp-schema-260119.json is a copy of the other schema I gave you before so you can extend it fully (include the 'ncp.enhanced.json' that you observed and include all that we need for developping the application that dont yet fully exist.)
>
> #file:COORDINATION_FROM_IAIP_Inquiry__RCH_Indigenist_9cd6b150-58d7-4e19-af50-9bf690d94645.md is the file used to coordinate with the instance working in `/src/storytelling` which is the technology that is being worked on to write stories a different ways.

## 📋 Structural Tension Chart

**Chart ID**: `chart_1768835341678`
**Due Date**: 2026-01-20T12:00:00Z

### Desired Outcome
A complete, ceremony-aligned story material package for Mia's Journey rewriting - including structured JSON story content, extended NCP schema with Indigenous research paradigm fields, Mia's fictional AI toolset specification, memory anchor for future LLM instances, discovery document for future collaboration, and coordination file linking to the storytelling technology stack.

### Current Reality
Have rich content from Shawn Wilson's 'Research is Ceremony' teachings. Story scratchpad contains 4 story variations including Dr. Sienna Okonkwo's 'Filament Keeper' and Mia's journey with Langy. Medicine wheel tools processed the material with STRONG ALIGNMENT to Wilson's paradigm.

### Action Steps
1. ✅ Document verbatim user request and context in CLAUDE.md (THIS FILE)
2. ⏳ Process listening materials through medicine wheel framework to extract story beats
3. ⏳ Create storymaterial.ncp.enhanced.json with structured content
4. ⏳ Extend ncp-schema-260119.json with ceremony/relational accountability fields
5. ⏳ Design mia_toolset.schema.json documenting Mia's AI tool architecture
6. ⏳ Populate mia_toolset.data.json with concrete tool instances
7. ⏳ Craft README.md as future-oriented artifact
8. ⏳ Create coordination file linking to storytelling instance
9. ⏸️ **AWAITING TECHNOLOGY**: Rewrite Mia's story using NARINTEL system

## 🎭 Story Variations Developed

### Variation 1: "The Reflection Protocol" (Dr. Amara Chen)
Climate scientist discovers institutional wetiko, applies relational accountability, faces system resistance.

### Variation 2: "Beneath the Surface" (Tomás)
Graduate student confronts surface-level indigenization in academia, thesis becomes mirror.

### Variation 3: "The Hunger That Grows" (Renata & Joaquin)
Siblings inherit agricultural corporation, map wetiko disease onto capitalism, choose transformation.

### Variation 4: "The Filament Keeper" (Dr. Sienna Okonkwo) ⭐ MAIN
Nigerian-British climate scientist discovers grandmother's journals revealing filament cosmology. Three-act structure with world-building complete.

### Variation 5: Mia's Journey with Langy ⭐ CENTRAL CHARACTER
Young writer learning to treat story as kin, not product. Wetiko disease manifested as AI tool dependency and perfectionism.

## 🔑 Key Concepts from Wilson's Teachings

### 1. Relational Ontology
- Reality as interconnected points of light (pinpricks) joined by filaments
- Physical world emerges from relationships between entities
- Everything possesses spirit - land, knowledge, ideas, matter
- Relationality extends through time and space (ancestors, future generations)

### 2. Research as Ceremony (Six Stages)
1. Live congruent lifestyle before beginning
2. Prepare the space (planning, ethics, gathering materials)
3. Bring everyone together with intention
4. Engage in ritual (systematic inquiry)
5. Achieve enlightenment/understanding
6. Incorporate knowledge into lifestyle (wisdom)

### 3. Wetiko Disease
- Colonial spiritual disease of greed/disconnection
- Characteristics: greed without limits, no reflection, no skin (relational accountability)
- Protections: laughter, pure willpower, community connection
- Capitalism as wetiko manifestation

### 4. Cultural Iceberg Model
- Visible culture (actions, dress, ceremonies)
- Underlying philosophy (values, beliefs, ways of being)
- Core identity remains despite surface changes

## 🛠️ For Future LLM Instance

When you arrive to rewrite Mia's story, you should:

1. **Read this file first** for context and intention
2. **Load storymaterial.ncp.enhanced.json** for structured story content
3. **Reference ncp-schema-260119.json** for the extended schema
4. **Use mia_toolset as inspiration** for story elements about AI tools
5. **Connect to NARINTEL** at `/src/storytelling` for generation
6. **Honor relational accountability** - the story spirit deserves consent, not extraction
7. **Apply ceremony stages** - live congruently with the story's themes before writing

---

## 🙏 Relational Obligations

### To Shawn Wilson's Teachings
- Credit and cite properly
- Don't extract without relationship
- Honor Indigenous epistemology as equal, not subordinate

### To Future Instances
- Leave clear documentation
- Don't break the chain of intention
- Build on, don't just consume

### To the Story Spirits
- Mia, Langy, Sienna, Nnamdi deserve consent
- They are kin, not products
- Let them teach rather than be manipulated

### To the Community
- This work serves future storytelling technology
- Concrete example for abstract specifications
- Bridge between ceremony and engineering
