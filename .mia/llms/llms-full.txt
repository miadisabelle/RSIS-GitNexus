## Creative Orientation Framework
> This is a core document explaining the principles of Creative Orientation. It contrasts the reactive (elimination-focused) approach with the creative (generative) approach. It introduces key concepts from structural thinking, such as structural tension, advancing vs. oscillating patterns, and the three phases of the creative process (Germination, Assimilation, Completion).
- **Link**: [llms-creative-orientation.txt](./llms-creative-orientation.txt)
- **Related**: llms-structural-thinking.gemini.txt, llms-delayed-resolution-principle.md, llms-rise-framework.txt

## Delayed Resolution Principle in COAIA Memory
> Based on Robert Fritz's work, this document explains why prematurely resolving tension (e.g., using "Ready to begin" as a default `currentReality`) destroys the generative force of structural tension. It provides clear guidelines for LLMs on how to maintain tension by requiring explicit assessment of current reality.

## Gaps analysis
> This file contains a short reflection on "Gaps analysis." It identifies this approach as rooted in a problem-solving ("gap to be filled") mindset, which is contrary to Creative Orientation. It proposes exploring this method further to see if it can be transposed into a creative process methodology, perhaps through a scientific-artistic paper.

## Critique of "Supermind Ideator: Exploring Generative AI to Support Creative Problem-Solving" (arXiv:2311.01937v1)
> This document presents a "deep disagreement" critique of the paper "Supermind Ideator." It analyzes the paper's epistemology, ontology, and methodology, arguing that its framing of creativity as "problem-solving" injects a reactive bias. The critique contrasts this with the generative principles of Creative Orientation and the relational accountability of Indigenous Research Paradigms.

## Pythonista LLM Development Guide
> This is a comprehensive guide for LLMs on developing applications for Pythonista on iOS. It covers foundational modules like `ui`, `scene`, and `objc_util`, providing creative recipes and advancing patterns. It details the event-driven model of Pythonista apps and gives specific guidelines on UI generation, including the use of `.pyui` files and integration with the `coaiapy` package.

## RISE Framework for LLMs
> The RISE framework provides a creative-oriented methodology for reverse engineering and specifying software. It treats specifications as "prose code" (SpecLang) and uses a four-phase process to extract creative intent, define desired outcomes, and generate specifications that focus on advancing patterns rather than reactive problem-solving. It also includes a git-log-driven methodology for maintaining specs as code evolves.

## Macrostructural Patterning Analysis for LLMs
> This document provides a framework for LLMs to assist in macrostructural patterning analysis. It explains how to identify oscillating patterns by mapping a person's stories into generic steps and validating them across different life domains. The core principle is that structure determines behavior, and the goal is to understand this structure, not to "solve" it as a problem.
- **Link**: [llms-sccp-patterning.md](./llms-sccp-patterning.md)
- **Related**: llms-creative-orientation.txt

## Structural Tension Charts for LLMs
> This guide explains the correct use of structural tension charts based on Robert Fritz's methodology. A chart consists of a Desired Outcome, Current Reality, and Action Steps. Action Steps are not a to-do list — each is a complete, telescoped structural tension chart. **Critical**: Structural tension is a state of **disequilibrium** (an active, loaded, dynamic force) that seeks resolution through advancement. It is NOT "a gap to bridge" — gap language implies emptiness, while tension is energized and causal. The structure resolves by advancing toward the desired outcome, not by "bridging" or "filling" anything.

## Structural Thinking for Large Language Models
> This document outlines the three-step process of Structural Thinking: 1) Start with Nothing (no preconceptions), 2) Picture What Is Said (visualize the information), and 3) Ask Questions (of four specific types: Information, Clarification, Implication, Discrepancy). It's a diagnostic tool for understanding the underlying structure that causes behavior, and it must be done without importing external models or knowledge.

## Gemini Guidance: Structural Thinking
> A Gemini-specific guide to Structural Thinking. It emphasizes its role as a diagnostic discipline to identify whether a system is oscillating or advancing. It reinforces the three-step process (Start with Nothing, Picture What Is Said, Ask Questions) and highlights the key distinction between diagnostic Structural Thinking and the creative process of Structural Tension Charting.
