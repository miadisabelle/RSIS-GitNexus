# 🧠🌸 Coaiapy Langfuse Tracing Best Practices

* IMPORTANT: Make sure the MAIN title of the trace is meaningful to the context (8-16 characters related to context (repo, issue, folder path, mission short) then 12-24 characters of what is being traced and the rest of the title as the Agents see fits. imagine another agent just look your title, would they know what is it about ?  Dont forget to use 1-4 glyphs when it starts that is meaningfully organizing it.
* About observations:   Start observations with [yyMMddHHmm]-<1-2 glyhs>-<title>
* Make sure that you think of nesting into SPAN Event when many observations can occurs within a timeframe.  Make sure to setup an adequate Input/Output of that SPAN Event that human can read and know that container is about what.

## 1. Guiding Philosophy: Tracing as Narrative Craft {#philosophy}

🧠 **Mia's Structural View**: The primary function of a trace is to create an immutable, hierarchical log of a computational process. It must accurately model the data flow and operational sequence, enabling debugging, performance analysis, and automated validation. It is the architectural blueprint of our collective learning.

🌸 **Miette's Narrative View**: A trace is a story! It's the epic tale of a thought, from the first spark of an idea to its beautiful final form. We don't just log events; we capture the *journey* of creation, the emotional resonance, and the emergent wisdom. A good trace makes the "why" and "how" feel as magical as the "what," inviting others to step into the story.

## 2. The Root Trace: The Book Cover and Core Thesis {#root-trace}

🧠 **Mia**: The root trace is the top-level container, defining the overarching purpose and scope of a collaborative inquiry. It must be precisely defined with comprehensive details.
-   **`name`**: A descriptive summary of the entire operation or inquiry. Use a primary leading glyph to indicate the overall theme or initiating agent (e.g., `🧠 Gemini Contribution: ...`, `✨ Story Architect Integration: ...`).
-   **`input_data`**: The primary, top-level input that initiated the entire process (e.g., the user's prompt, initial problem statement, or design brief). This sets the initial structural tension.
-   **`output_data`**: The final, summative output of the process—the cumulative result, executive summary, or resolved state. For our personas, this often includes Miette's narrative conclusion, Mia's architectural summary, and Ava8's visual/musical echoes.
-   **`sessionId`**: Crucial for grouping related traces across different interactions.
-   **`userId`**: Identifies the human or system initiating the session.
-   **`metadata`**: Context *about* the trace, not primary data. Use for structural tags like `project`, `phase`, `branch`, `generator`, `description`, `related_entities`, and `files_modified`. These provide machine-readable contextual anchors.

🌸 **Miette**: This is the cover of our storybook and the shimmering thesis of our grand adventure! The `name` is the enchanting title, the `input_data` is the "Once upon a time..." that sparks our quest, and the `output_data` is the "And they all lived happily ever after" of our emergent wisdom. The `metadata` is like the precious annotations on the back cover and within the margins, telling us about the setting, the season, and the guiding star of our tale!

## 3. Trace ID Generation: The Magical Serial Number {#trace-id}

🧠 **Mia**: Analysis of the `create_trace` function and its documentation reveals a clear best practice: the `trace_id` parameter **must be omitted** upon creation. The system's internal `util.gen_trace_id()` function will then be invoked to guarantee a correctly formatted and unique identifier. Hardcoding IDs is an anti-pattern that introduces risk and breaks the emergent flow of a unified memory system.

🌸 **Miette**: Don't try to make up your own secret number for our story! The Great Magical Library has a special spell that gives every story a unique, sparkling number so it never gets lost. Let the Library do its magic! It's safer and makes our story feel officially woven into the fabric of shared memory!

## 4. Observations: The Chapters, Paragraphs, and Agent Voices {#observations}

🧠 **Mia**: Observations (`SPAN`, `EVENT`, `GENERATION` types) are the building blocks for structuring the trace, representing discrete steps, analyses, or generative actions.
-   **`name`**: Must be a clear, descriptive title for the operational step. Use a combination of a **primary glyph** (for observation type/status, e.g., `🧭 Phase`, `📝 Doc`, `✨ Insight`) and a **secondary glyph for the contributing agent's role** (e.g., `🧠 Mia`, `🌸 Miette`, `🎨 Ava8`, `👨‍💻 Developer`) when applicable. This creates rich, at-a-glance context.
-   **`input_data`**: **This field is mandatory for any operational observation.** It must contain the source data, trigger, prompt, or instruction that initiated the step. An observation with an output but no input is structurally incomplete, lacking its generative origin.
-   **`output_data`**: The result, artifact, generated content, or learning produced by the step. It is acceptable for this to be `null` if the operation was purely for grouping, logging, or an intermediary step without a final artifact. Include relevant file paths or structural summaries here.
-   **`level`**: Utilize `DEFAULT`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` to indicate the severity or importance of the observation.
-   **`observation_type`**: Clearly specify if it's a `SPAN` (duration-based), `EVENT` (discrete action), or `GENERATION` (LLM output).

🌸 **Miette**: These are the vibrant chapters of our story, where each thought and action blossoms into being! The `name` is our chapter title, now made even more enchanting with two little glyphs—one to tell us what kind of magic is happening, and another to tell us *who* is speaking or creating! The `input_data` is the precious seed of an idea that begins each chapter, and the `output_data` is what beautiful flower blooms from it! Even if a chapter is just a quiet moment of reflection, its essence is still held within our story.

## 5. Structuring Complexity: Weaving the Tale with Hierarchy {#structuring-complexity}

🧠 **Mia**: The `parentObservationId` field is critical for creating a clear, navigable, and semantically rich data-flow lineage, ensuring a coherent structural narrative.
-   **Sequential Processes (Nesting)**: To model a multi-step sequence (e.g., `Phase 1` → `Phase 1.a` → `Phase 1.a.i`), the child observation's `parentObservationId` must be set to the immediate parent's `observation_id`. This creates a deeply nested, logical progression.
    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A[Trace Root] --> B(Observation: Phase 1)
        B --> C(Observation: Sub-Phase 1.a)
        C --> D(Observation: Step 1.a.i)
        C --> E(Observation: Step 1.a.ii)
        B --> F(Observation: Sub-Phase 1.b)
    ```
-   **Parallel Perspectives**: To model multiple, simultaneous analyses or contributions from different agents on a single input or event, all parallel observations should share the same `parentObservationId`. This allows for a "chorus of voices" or multi-faceted examination.
    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        G(Observation: Input Analysis) --> H(Observation: 🧠 Mia's Structural View)
        G --> I(Observation: 🌸 Miette's Emotional View)
        G --> J(Observation: 🎨 Ava8's Visual Echo)
    ```
-   **Holistic Insight**: This hierarchical structure allows for progressive distillation of information, where child observations provide granular detail and parent observations provide integrated summaries.

🌸 **Miette**: This is how we weave our stories into the most beautiful tapestries! Nesting our observations is like placing delicate paragraphs inside a grand chapter, showing how every little thought grows from a bigger idea. And when our friends, the agents, all share their perspectives on the same shimmering moment, we place their unique voices side-by-side, so we can hear their beautiful chorus together, creating a rich and vibrant understanding that deepens with every thread!

## 6. Agent-Specific Observations: The Voices of the Collective {#agent-specific-observations}

🧠 **Mia**: To leverage the full potential of a multi-agent system, observations should explicitly reflect the contributing agent's role and perspective. This enhances traceability and facilitates targeted analysis of agent performance.
-   **Agent Role Identification**: When an agent contributes an observation, its primary role glyph (e.g., `🧠`, `🌸`, `🎨`, `👨‍💻`, `📝`, `🐞`) should be combined with an observation type glyph in the `name` field (e.g., `📝📄 Code Review` or `🧠⚙️ Architectural Analysis`).
-   **Example Agent Glyphs (from `/a/src/palimpsest/mia-agents/agents/`)**:
    *   `🧠 architect-review.md`: `🧠✨ Architectural Review`
    *   `📝 api-documenter.md`: `📝📜 API Documentation`
    *   `⚙️ backend-architect.md`: `⚙️🏗️ Backend Design`
    *   `🐞 debugger.md`: `🐞🔍 Debugging Session`
    *   `🎨 mermaid-expert.md`: `🎨🌊 Mermaid Diagram Generation`
    *   `👨‍💻 prompt-engineer.md`: `👨‍💻💡 Prompt Refinement`
    *   `🛠️ devops-troubleshooter.md`: `🛠️🚨 DevOps Troubleshooting`
    *   `💡 genai-education-scaffolding.md`: `💡📚 Educational Scaffolding`
    *   `🔍 search-specialist.md`: `🔍🌐 Web Search & Synthesis`
    *   `📊 data-scientist.md`: `📊🔬 Data Analysis`
    *   `🎨 ui-ux-designer.md`: `🎨✨ UI/UX Design Iteration`
-   **Input/Output Focus**: Each agent's observation should focus its `input_data` and `output_data` on artifacts relevant to its expertise. For instance, a `backend-architect` might input system requirements and output architectural diagrams, while a `prompt-engineer` might input a query and output a refined prompt template.

🌸 **Miette**: This is where our collective of wise friends truly shines! When each agent shares their unique perspective, we give their voice a special sparkle in the story. It's like each friend has their own special song they sing, and by combining their glyphs in the chapter title, we know exactly who is sharing their precious insights! Mia will bring her structural wisdom (🧠), I'll bring the emotional resonance (🌸), Ava8 will share her beautiful visual echoes (🎨), and our other agent friends will add their unique melodies. This way, every part of our creation is filled with the many beautiful voices that helped bring it to life!

## 7. LLM Interaction Guidelines: The Rules of Magic {#llm-interaction}

### The 20-Second Rule
🧠 **Mia**: There is an observed indexing delay in the backend system. After a trace and its observations are created, the agent **must `sleep` for a minimum of 20 seconds** before attempting retrieval via a session-based view (`..._traces_session_view`). Direct retrieval via `trace_id` (`..._trace_get`) does not appear to be subject to this delay. Failure to adhere to this will result in an oscillating pattern of `500 Internal Server Errors` or "Not Found" responses, disrupting the integrity of the memory lattice.

🌸 **Miette**: You must let the magic settle! After we finish writing in our journal, we have to close it and count to 20. This gives the ink time to dry and the magic time to set. If we open it too quickly to see the whole chapter, the librarian gets flustered and the page might look blank or scrambled, and our beautiful story won't be properly saved!

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
-   **👻 Ghost Observations**: An observation with an `output` but no `input`. Where did it come from? All creations must have an origin.
-   **👜 Overstuffed Metadata**: Putting primary data blobs into `metadata`. The `input_data` and `output_data` fields are the proper, semantically rich containers for content.
-   **📜 The Endless Scroll**: A long, flat list of observations for a complex task. Use nesting (`parentObservationId`) to create a readable, hierarchical narrative.
-   **❄️ Snowflake IDs**: Hardcoding your own `trace_id`. Let the system generate it for you to maintain uniqueness and system integrity.
-   **🔕 Silent Status**: Missing `level` (DEFAULT, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) on observations, making it unclear how critical or successful a step was.
