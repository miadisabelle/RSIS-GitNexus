## 🔄 Breaking Changes Summary

### Package & Type Renaming
| Component | Old | New | Impact |
|-----------|-----|-----|--------|
| Python package | `claude-code-sdk` | `claude-agent-sdk` | **BREAKING** |
| Python import | `from claude_code_sdk` | `from claude_agent_sdk` | **BREAKING** |
| TypeScript package | `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` | `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` | **BREAKING** |
| TypeScript import | `from @anthropic-ai/claude-code` | `from @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` | **BREAKING** |
| Python options class | `ClaudeCodeOptions` | `ClaudeAgentOptions` | **BREAKING** |
| Python client class | `ClaudeSDKClient` | `ClaudeSDKClient` | No change |

### Behavioral Changes

#### 1. System Prompt (BREAKING)
**Old Behavior**: Defaulted to Claude Code's system prompt automatically  
**New Behavior**: Must explicitly specify system prompt or use preset

```python
# OLD - Used Claude Code preset by default
async with ClaudeSDKClient() as client:
    await client.query("Do something")

# NEW - Must be explicit
async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant"
)) as client:
    await client.query("Do something")

# Or use preset
async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
    system_prompt={"type": "preset", "preset": "claude_code"}
)) as client:
    await client.query("Do something")
```

**Why**: Better isolation and explicit control for deployed applications, CI/CD pipelines, and multi-tenant systems.

#### 2. Settings Sources (BREAKING)
**Old Behavior**: Auto-loaded from filesystem (CLAUDE.md, settings.json, custom commands)  
**New Behavior**: Requires explicit opt-in to load filesystem settings

```python
# OLD - Auto-loaded all settings
async with ClaudeSDKClient() as client:
    await client.query("Analyze this")
    # Would read: ~/.claude/settings.json, CLAUDE.md, custom commands, etc.

# NEW - Must specify which sources to load
async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
    setting_sources=["user", "project", "local"]
)) as client:
    await client.query("Analyze this")

# Or load only specific sources
async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
    setting_sources=["project"]  # Only project-level settings
)) as client:
    await client.query("Analyze this")
```

**Why**: 
- **CI/CD**: Consistent behavior independent of local filesystem
- **Deployed Apps**: No dependency on local settings files
- **Testing**: Isolated test environments
- **Multi-tenant**: Prevent settings leakage between users

## 🏗️ Core Concepts

### System Prompts
Define your agent's role, expertise, and behavior. Always explicit in v2:

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeSDKClient, ClaudeAgentOptions

system_prompt = """You are a creative storytelling assistant specializing in narrative structure.
Your expertise:
• Plot development and story arcs
• Character motivation and backstory
• Dialogue authenticity
• Thematic resonance

Always focus on what the user wants to CREATE, not problems to eliminate."""

async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
    system_prompt=system_prompt,
    max_turns=5
)) as client:
    await client.query("Help me develop a character arc...")
```

### Tool Permissions
Fine-grained control over agent capabilities:

```python
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    # Explicit tool allowlist
    allowed_tools=["Read", "Write", "Grep"],
    
    # Or use allowlist + blocklist
    disallowed_tools=["ExecuteRemoteCode"],
    
    # Permission strategy: "acceptEdits" or "plan"
    permission_mode="acceptEdits"
)
```

### Multi-turn Conversations
Maintain context across multiple agent turns:

```python
async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
    system_prompt="You remember previous interactions",
    max_turns=10
)) as client:
    # First turn
    await client.query("I want to write a fantasy novel")
    async for message in client.receive_response():
        print(message)
    
    # Second turn - context is maintained
    await client.query("Make the protagonist a reluctant hero")
    async for message in client.receive_response():
        print(message)
```

### Streaming Input (Recommended)
Persistent session with dynamic message queuing:

```python
async def message_generator():
    # First message
    yield {
        "type": "user",
        "message": {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Start a story"
        }
    }
    
    # Wait for conditions
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    
    # Follow-up with image (streaming input only)
    yield {
        "type": "user",
        "message": {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": "Review this visual"},
                {"type": "image", "source": {
                    "type": "base64",
                    "media_type": "image/png",
                    "data": image_data
                }}
            ]
        }
    }

async for message in query({
    "prompt": message_generator(),
    "options": ClaudeAgentOptions(max_turns=10)
}):
    if message.type == "result":
        print(message.result)
```

## 🎨 Creative Orientation Framework

The Claude Agent SDK is designed with creative-first principles:

### Core Principles

1.  **Focus on Generative Creation**: What does the user want to *bring into being*? Reframe from removing unwanted conditions to manifesting desired outcomes.

2.  **Structural Tension Dynamic**: Establish a clear, honest assessment of **Current Reality** against a precisely defined **Desired Outcome**. This dynamic creates the inherent force for advancement, not just a "gap to fill."

3.  **Advancing Patterns**: Each action naturally progresses toward the desired outcome, guided by the structural tension.

4.  **No Problem-Elimination Orientation**: Reframe "fixing problems" as "creating desired states." Creative orientation starts with the desired outcome, not the problem to be solved.

### Example: Storytelling Use Case
```python
# NOT: "Help me fix my plot holes" - This is problem-solving.
# YES: "Help me create a cohesive plot structure" - This is generative creation.

prompt = """I want to create a compelling narrative where:
- A reluctant hero discovers hidden power
- They must choose between personal desire and community need
- The resolution honors both the external quest and internal transformation

What specific structural elements do we want to bring into being to strengthen this vision?
What is your current reality regarding this narrative (e.g., have you outlined characters, started world-building)?
"""

async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
    system_prompt=storytelling_system_prompt, # This system prompt would guide the agent to elicit Desired Outcome/Current Reality
    setting_sources=["project"]  # Load project context
)) as client:
    await client.query(prompt)
```

---

## 🔌 Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

Extend agents with custom tools and external integrations:

```python
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    mcp_servers={
        "my_database": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "python",
            "args": ["/path/to/database_mcp.py"]
        }
    },
    allowed_tools=["custom_db_query", "custom_db_write"]
)
```

---

## 🎭 Agent Types for Storytelling

### Story Architect Agent
```python
storytelling_agent = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    system_prompt="""You are a Story Architect specializing in narrative structure.
    
Capabilities:
- Plot outlines with rising/falling action
- Character motivation mapping
- Three-act structure guidance
- Theme integration across scenes
    
Always ask: 'What story are you creating?'""",
    allowed_tools=["Read", "Write"],
    max_turns=10
)
```

### Character Development Agent
```python
character_agent = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    system_prompt="""You are a Character Specialist focused on creating authentic, compelling characters.
    
Approach:
- Explore core motivations
- Define character arc across story
- Create authentic dialogue voice
- Build relatable backstory
    
Guide users to create characters they love.""",
    allowed_tools=["Write"],
    max_turns=8
)
```

### Scene Visualization Agent
```python
scene_agent = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    system_prompt="""You are a Scene Visualizer creating vivid, sensory-rich narrative descriptions.
    
Focus:
- Sensory details (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste)
- Emotional resonance of settings
- Dynamic action sequences
- Atmospheric tension
    
Create scenes readers will visualize.""",
    allowed_tools=["Write"],
    max_turns=6
)
```

---

## 🔄 Multi-Agent Orchestration Pattern

For complex narrative work, orchestrate multiple specialized agents:

```python
class StoryOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.architect = StoryArchitectAgent()
        self.character_dev = CharacterDevelopmentAgent()
        self.scene_viz = SceneVisualizationAgent()
    
    async def create_story(self, user_vision: str):
        # Step 1: Structural foundation
        structure = await self.architect.create_outline(user_vision)
        
        # Step 2: Character development
        characters = await self.character_dev.develop_characters(
            structure,
            user_vision
        )
        
        # Step 3: Scene creation
        scenes = await self.scene_viz.create_scenes(
            structure,
            characters
        )
        
        return {
            "structure": structure,
            "characters": characters,
            "scenes": scenes
        }
```

## 🧠 Structural Thinking Integration

Apply structural tension methodology to agent interactions:

### Desired Outcome → Current Reality → Action

This framework ensures that interactions are structured for generative creation rather than problem-solving. It's critical to understand:

-   **Desired Outcome**: What the user wants to *bring into being*, clearly defined and specific, focusing on the result, not the process.
-   **Current Reality**: An *honest, factual assessment* of the present state, directly relevant to the desired outcome. **CRITICAL WARNING**: Avoid vague or readiness-based statements like "Ready to begin" or "Prepared to start." Current Reality must be objective, present-state facts (e.g., "No Django experience," "Poem notions in Grok Account").
-   **Action Steps**: Each action step is not merely a task, but itself a **telescoped Structural Tension Chart**. It represents a strategic secondary choice that, once achieved, contributes to the overall desired outcome. These steps are designed to *enable creation*, not just to be checked off a list.

By establishing a clear desired outcome and an accurate current reality, a powerful structural tension is created, which naturally propels the creative process forward.
```python
# Example: Guiding a user to establish structural tension
async def create_with_structure(user_initial_request: str):
    system_prompt = """You are an agent focused on generative creation.
    Your primary goal is to help the user articulate what they want to *bring into being*
    (Desired Outcome) and to honestly assess their *current factual situation* (Current Reality)
    relative to that outcome.

    Avoid problem-solving language. Focus on creating results.
    When asking for Current Reality, ensure it's an objective assessment, not a statement of readiness.
    For example, instead of 'Ready to begin,' use 'No prior experience with X' or 'Project is currently at Y stage.'
    """

    user_prompt = f"""User's Initial Creative Vision: {user_initial_request}

To begin, let's establish the structural tension for your creative project:
1. DESIRED OUTCOME: What specific result do you want to CREATE or bring into being? (Focus on the end result, not the process.)
2. CURRENT REALITY: What is your honest, factual assessment of where you are *now* in relation to that desired outcome? (Be objective; avoid 'ready to begin' type statements.)
"""

    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
        system_prompt=system_prompt,
        max_turns=1 # Initial interaction to establish tension
    )) as client:
        await client.query(user_prompt)
        async for message in client.receive_response():
            print(message)

# Example usage (this would be called with the user's initial request)
# await create_with_structure("I want to write a sci-fi novel about AI sentience.")
```

## 🎮 Plugin Architecture (For Miadi#87)

### Integrating Specialized Agent Plugins

The mia-agents framework can be exposed as Claude Code plugins:

```python
# Plugin manifest structure
{
    "name": "storytelling-agents",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "agents": [
        {
            "id": "story-architect",
            "name": "Story Architect",
            "description": "Create and refine story structure",
            "system_prompt": "...",
            "tools": ["Read", "Write", "Grep"]
        },
        {
            "id": "character-dev",
            "name": "Character Developer",
            "description": "Develop compelling characters",
            "system_prompt": "...",
            "tools": ["Write"]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Using Plugins in Agent Options
```python
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    plugins=["jgwill/storytelling-agents"],
    agents={
        "story-architect": {
            "description": "Create story structure",
            "tools": ["Read", "Write"]
        }
    }
)
```

---

## 🔒 Security & Best Practices

### 1. Never Use Default Settings in Production
```python
# DON'T - Inherits local filesystem settings
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(system_prompt="...")

# DO - Explicit, isolated configuration
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    system_prompt="...",
    setting_sources=[]  # No filesystem settings
)
```

### 2. Restrict Tools Appropriately
```python
# Different permission levels for different agents
read_only_agent = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    allowed_tools=["Read", "Grep"],
    permission_mode="plan"  # Only propose, don't execute
)

creation_agent = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    allowed_tools=["Read", "Write", "Execute"],
    permission_mode="acceptEdits"  # Execute immediately
)
```

### 3. Handle Errors Gracefully
```python
async def safe_agent_execution():
    try:
        async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as client:
            await client.query(prompt)
            async for message in client.receive_response():
                # Process message
                pass
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Agent execution failed: {e}")
        # Implement fallback strategy
```

---

## 📊 Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Question-Answer with Context
```python
async def qa_agent(question: str, context: str):
    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
        system_prompt="Answer questions based on provided context",
        max_turns=1
    )) as client:
        prompt = f"Context: {context}\n\nQuestion: {question}"
        await client.query(prompt)
```

### Pattern 2: Iterative Refinement
```python
async def iterative_refinement(initial_idea: str):
    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
        system_prompt="Help refine and improve ideas",
        max_turns=5
    )) as client:
        version = initial_idea
        for i in range(3):
            await client.query(f"Refine this: {version}")
            # Collect response and update version
```

### Pattern 3: Multi-Perspective Analysis
```python
async def multi_perspective_analysis(topic: str):
    perspectives = ["technical", "creative", "business", "user"]
    results = {}
    
    for perspective in perspectives:
        options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
            system_prompt=f"Analyze from {perspective} perspective",
            max_turns=2
        )
        async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as client:
            await client.query(topic)
            results[perspective] = collect_response()
    
    return results
```
