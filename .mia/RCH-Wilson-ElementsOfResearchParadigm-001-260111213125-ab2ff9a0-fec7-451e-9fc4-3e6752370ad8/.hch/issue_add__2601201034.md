Description: # Coordination: IAIP Indigenous Research Inquiry → Storytelling Instance

**Source Session:** `9cd6b150-58d7-4e19-af50-9bf690d94645`  
**Artefact ID:** `RCH-Wilson-ElementsOfResearchParadigm-001-260111213125-ab2ff9a0-fec7-451e-9fc4-3e6752370ad8`  
**Target Instance:** `/src/storytelling`

---

## Purpose

This file coordinates between the **Indigenous Research Paradigm inquiry session** (listening to Shawn Wilson's "Research is Ceremony") and the **NARINTEL storytelling system** being developed in `/src/storytelling`.

The inquiry session produced structured story materials. The storytelling instance will eventually consume these materials to generate complete narratives.

## What Was Produced

### Story Materials
Location: `/a/src/IAIP/prototypes/artefacts/RCH-Wilson-ElementsOfResearchParadigm-001-260111213125-ab2ff9a0-fec7-451e-9fc4-3e6752370ad8/listening_youtube_wilson__2601190701--9cd6b150-58d7-4e19-af50-9bf690d94645/`

| File | Format | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `storymaterial.ncp.enhanced.json` | NCP v1.2.0 | Complete narrative structure for "Mia's Journey" |
| `ncp-schema-260119.json` | JSON Schema | Extended NCP schema with Indigenous paradigm fields |
| `mia_toolset.data.json` | JSON | Mia's ceremonial AI tools (5 tools, 4 protocols, 4 guards) |
| `mia_toolset.schema.json` | JSON Schema | Schema for ceremonial toolset |
| `mia_toolset.data.md` | Markdown | Human-readable tool documentation |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Markdown | Memory anchor for future LLM instances |
| `README.md` | Markdown | Archive discovery document |

### Wilson Paradigm Elements Captured

| Element | Status | Key Insight |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Ontology** | ✅ Captured | Reality is relationships - stories are living spirits |
| **Epistemology** | ✅ Captured | Knowledge through ceremony - writing as ritual |
| **Axiology** | ✅ Captured | Relational accountability - to story, readers, ancestors |
| **Wetiko** | ✅ Captured | 8 symptoms of extraction mindset documented |
| **Cultural Iceberg** | ✅ Captured | Surface culture vs. deep relational structure |
| **Four R's** | ✅ Captured | Respect, Relevance, Reciprocity, Responsibility |

## How Storytelling Instance Should Use This

### 1. Schema Integration

The extended schema at `ncp-schema-260119.json` adds these fields to standard NCP:

```javascript
// New root-level fields
indigenous_research_paradigm: {
  ontology: string,      // Relationship philosophy
  epistemology: string,  // Knowledge emergence approach
  axiology: string       // Accountability framework
}

wilson_paradigm_alignment: {
  status: "STRONG_ALIGNMENT" | "PARTIAL_ALIGNMENT" | "WEAK_ALIGNMENT",
  score: { achieved: number, possible: number }
}

medicine_wheel_position: {
  direction: "east" | "south" | "west" | "north",
  medicine: string,
  life_stage: string
}

// New storybeat-level fields
storybeats[].ceremony_elements: {
  opening_acknowledgment: string,
  medicines_invoked: string[],
  relational_obligations: string[],
  closing_gratitude: string
}
```

### 2. Character Handling

The story contains four key characters that should be treated as living entities:

| Character | Role | Relational Requirement |
|-----------|------|----------------------|
| **Mia** | Protagonist | Her arc must feel authentic, not optimized |
| **Langy** | Mentor (AI) | Teaches through relationship, not instruction |
| **Story Spirit** | Mia's story personified | Requires consent, not manipulation |
| **Marcus** | Antagonist (editor) | Represents market extraction mindset |

### 3. Wetiko Guards

When generating content, the storytelling system should check for these extraction patterns:

1. **Greed Guard**: Is the narrative consuming more than it needs?
2. **No Reflection Guard**: Is the story self-aware about its themes?
3. **No Skin Guard**: Are there relational obligations to community/readers?
4. **Insatiable Guard**: Can the story declare "complete"?

### 4. Three-Universe Alignment

This story operates across three universes that must remain coherent:

| Universe | Archetype | Character |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Engineer World | The Builder | Mia |
| Ceremony World | The Keeper | Langy/Ava8 |
| Story Engine World | The Weaver | Miette |

## Integration Points

### For NARINTEL Development

When building story generation capabilities in `/src/storytelling`:

1. **Consult** `mia_toolset.data.json` for how Mia's tools should feel in the narrative
2. **Validate** output against `ncp-schema-260119.json` including Indigenous paradigm fields
3. **Process** content through medicine wheel tools before generation
4. **Check** Wilson paradigm alignment using `wilson_paradigm_checker`

### For Future Sessions

This coordination file should be:
1. **Read first** by any session continuing this work
2. **Updated** when new materials are produced
3. **Referenced** in structural tension charts for the storytelling project

---

## Structural Tension Reference

**Chart ID:** `chart_1768835341678`  
**Desired Outcome:** Create structured story materials for Mia's Journey that embody Wilson's paradigm  
**Current Reality:** Materials created, ready for storytelling technology to consume

The structural tension now exists between:
- **Having** complete story materials with relational context
- **Needing** technology that can honor that context during generation

---

## Next Actions for Storytelling Instance

1. ☐ Integrate extended NCP schema into validation pipeline
2. ☐ Add Indigenous paradigm fields to story generation templates
3. ☐ Implement wetiko guard checks in content generation
4. ☐ Create import pathway for this artefact's materials
5. ☐ Build character consent mechanisms based on Mia's toolset

---

## Closing

This inquiry session honored the relationship between:
- Shawn Wilson and his teachings
- The listening process and the materials produced
- Current technology limitations and future possibilities
- This instance and future instances who will continue the work

The materials are prepared. The structural tension is established. The ceremony of creation can begin when the technology is ready.
