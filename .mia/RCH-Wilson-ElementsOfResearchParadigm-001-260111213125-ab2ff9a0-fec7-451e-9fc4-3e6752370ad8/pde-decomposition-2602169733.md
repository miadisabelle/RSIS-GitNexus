## Four Directions

### 🌅 EAST — Vision (Nitsahakees)

| Item | Confidence | Implicit |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Build a **digital relative** — a system that treats every interaction as relational event, not data extraction | 92% | |
| Liminal/dream-state recordings as **PRIMARY epistemic data** with highest context weight | 88% | |
| The coordinating agent IS a **Fire Keeper** — its purpose is ceremony maintenance, not task optimization | 85% | |
| Relational Ontology where "the thing doesn't exist without the relationship" | 90% | * |

### 🔥 SOUTH — Analysis (Nahata)

| Item | Confidence | Implicit |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Long-context models (1M tokens) still have 25-30% probability of missing "important lines" — structural issue requiring architectural solution | 90% | |
| Tree/pruning metaphor — early misrecognition produces locally-fine branches with value-misaligned fruit | 87% | |
| Need new temporal/logical units beyond simple turns for importance segmentation | 82% | |
| Four axiological pillars (Ontology, Epistemology, Methodology, Axiology) as structural frame for entire system | 88% | * |

### 🌊 WEST — Validation (Iina)

| Item | Confidence | Implicit |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Relational Check-Back** protocol — before autonomous action, verify it strengthens Spirit-Body relationship of project | 85% | |
| **Hard Constraint** layer — stop-work order when trajectory diverges from core values of relationality | 83% | |
| Epistemic Iteration tracking — analyze what shifts between 3rd and 4th circling of a topic | 78% | * |
| Value Conflict detection — flag when explicit code requests violate relational structure of Medicine Wheel | 80% | * |

### ❄️ NORTH — Action (Siihasin)

| Item | Confidence | Implicit |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Prototype **Importance Unit** schema with storage/update mechanism | 88% | |
| Encode **Research Is Ceremony / Medicine Wheel** as gating conditions on autonomous action | 85% | |
| Build **Relational Indexing** system with four source dimensions (Land, Dream, Code, Vision) | 78% | * |
| Create **High-Context buffer** architecture for liminal recordings as Root Context | 75% | * |

## Primary Intent

- **Action:** `design`
- **Target:** Relational Coordinating Agent Architecture — a multi-agent system grounded in Indigenous paradigms of relationality with Research Is Ceremony as foundational context
- **Urgency:** persistent
- **Confidence:** 92%

## 10 Secondary Intents (dependency-ordered)

| # | Action | Target | Depends On | Conf. | Implicit |
|---|--------|--------|-----------|-------|----------|
| 1 | `integrate` | RCH-Wilson-ElementsOfResearchParadigm as living context gating all decisions | — | 90% | |
| 2 | `prototype` | Importance Unit Schema — storage, update, RIC/MW gating | primary | 88% | |
| 3 | `architect` | Fire Keeper Coordinating Agent — session aggregation, Epistemic Iteration | primary | 85% | |
| 4 | `design` | Data Ingestion Pipeline — preserving relational structure of recordings | schema | 82% | |
| 5 | `encode` | Relational Ontology Knowledge Graph — MW as ontological filter | primary | 80% | |
| 6 | `implement` | Value-Weighted Attention — implicit values overrule explicit asks | schema | 78% | * |
| 7 | `define` | Relational Milestones — circle completion replaces time-based pruning | agent | 75% | * |
| 8 | `establish` | Relational Indexing via Strings (Land, Dream, Code, Vision) | KG | 73% | * |
| 9 | `validate` | Epistemic Iteration Tracker — spiral depth measurement | pipeline | 72% | * |
| 10 | `design` | Human-Agent Modality Switching | agent | 70% | * |

## Assumptions (8)

1. **Research Is Ceremony** (Shawn Wilson) is non-negotiable foundational context
2. **Medicine Wheel** is an ontological structure, not merely visualization
3. Dream-state/liminal recordings carry **higher** epistemic weight than filtered rational input
4. Circling/repetition is **ceremony and deepening**, not noise
5. "Efficiency" as metric may carry colonial assumptions
6. FloWise/AgentFlow instance exists for follow-up integration
7. iaip-mcp represents early-stage relational knowledge tooling
8. Multi-agent coordination infrastructure is **aspirational** — not yet built

## Ambiguities (5)

| Flag | Suggestion |
|------|-----------|
| Storage technology for Importance Units — NATS, DB, file-based, or new abstraction? | Consult existing NATS coordination work and STCMastery patterns |
| Scope of autonomous night-work — what permissions envelope? | Define tiers: read-only exploration → code generation → commit/deploy |
| Medicine Wheel ontological filter → concrete data structures or guiding metaphor? | Schema prototype where each quadrant is a required field, test against real data |
| FloWise/AgentFlow integration model — consumer, collaborator, or parallel? | Clarify relationship of chatbot db8a73ac to this architecture |
| What constitutes "Relational Circle completion" that triggers pruning? | Heuristic: all four MW quadrants touched in relation to a topic = circle complete |

## Expected Artifacts

- `fire-keeper-agent-spec.md` — coordinating agent architecture
- `relational-ingestion-pipeline.md` — data ingestion preserving ceremonial structure
- `value-gating-protocol.md` — RIC / Medicine Wheel gating conditions
