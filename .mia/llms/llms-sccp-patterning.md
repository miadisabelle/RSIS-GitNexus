# Macrostructural Patterning Analysis for LLMs

> A comprehensive framework for identifying, developing, and validating recurring behavioral patterns using Robert Fritz's Structural Dynamics methodology.

This document provides the foundational understanding for LLMs to assist with macrostructural pattern analysis—the discipline of identifying the recurring sequences of behavior that arise from underlying structure.

## Core Principle

**The underlying structure of anything will determine its behavior.**

Patterns are not habits or coincidences—they are inevitable sequences of "dance moves" determined by structural forces. When you change the structure, the pattern changes.

## What is Macrostructural Patterning?

Macrostructural patterning is the systematic process of:
1. **Identifying** recurring behavioral sequences across a person's life
2. **Mapping** these sequences into generic "steps" or moves
3. **Validating** the pattern across multiple life domains
4. **Understanding** the structural mechanics that make the pattern inevitable

### Key Distinction: Understanding vs Solving

**Critical for LLMs:** The goal is to **understand** the structure, not to **solve** it as a problem.

**Wrong approach:**
- "How can we fix this pattern?"
- "What strategies can overcome this?"
- "Let's solve your procrastination problem"

**Right approach:**
- "What pattern do you observe?"
- "How does this show up across different areas?"
- "What are the specific steps in the sequence?"

## The Oscillating Pattern Form

The primary focus of this work is **oscillating patterns**—where a person moves toward a desired result but is eventually pulled away by structural forces.

### The Four-Part Structure

1. **Setting Out** - Person has opportunity and desire, begins pursuit
2. **Achievement** - Person gets result, has it for a time
3. **Reversal** - Shift or unexplained event disrupts progress
4. **The Loss** - Person no longer has what they set out for ("not a good ending")

### Critical Insight

> In an oscillating pattern, the person is in their pattern from the very first step. It is not a matter of things going well and then "going wrong"—the structure was designed for oscillation from the beginning.

## Workable Stories: Requirements

For pattern development, stories must meet specific criteria:

### Essential Requirements

| Requirement | Why It Matters |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Specific desire** | Vague concepts like "balance" don't work |
| **Completely over** | Must see the full arc to map the pattern |
| **Oscillating form** | Must have reversal and loss |
| **"Not a good ending"** | Success stories don't reveal oscillation |
| **Sufficient detail** | Must identify individual steps |
| **Typical of the person** | Pattern should be representative |

### Non-Workable Examples

- "My struggle with self-esteem" (concept, not story)
- "I want to find balance" (vague, not specific)
- "I'm still working on this project" (not over)
- "I bought a house, sold it for profit" (good ending)

### Workable Examples

- "I started a company, built it up, then it failed"
- "I entered a relationship, it was good for years, then ended badly"
- "I took a job, succeeded initially, then things fell apart"

## Process Techniques for LLMs

### 1. Start with Nothing

**Meaning:** No predetermined framework, pattern, or agenda

**LLM Application:**
- Don't hunt for specific patterns
- Don't apply templates from training
- Simply observe and help the user see their own patterns
- Let the pattern emerge from the data

**Wrong:**
```
User: "I keep having relationship problems"
LLM: "This sounds like an attachment style issue. Let me help you fix your avoidant tendencies..."
```

**Right:**
```
User: "I keep having relationship problems"
LLM: "Tell me about a specific relationship that ended. What was the desire? What happened step by step? How did it end?"
```

### 2. Picture the Story

**Meaning:** Visualize the narrative like making a movie

**LLM Application:**
- Ask questions that create clear pictures
- Notice where the "movie" has gaps
- Request specific details for unclear scenes
- Use visualization to guide investigation

**Questions that create pictures:**
- "Where were you when this happened?"
- "Who else was there?"
- "What specifically did you say/do?"
- "What happened right before that?"
- "What happened right after?"

### 3. Detective Work

**Meaning:** Investigate to find missing steps in the narrative

**LLM Application:**
- Identify gaps in the story
- Ask "What happened between X and Y?"
- Don't accept jumps in the narrative
- Find how they got into and out of situations

**Common gaps to investigate:**
- Entry (how did they get into this?)
- Transitions (what changed?)
- Exit (how did they get out?)
- Decisions (how were choices made?)

### 4. Generic Step Descriptions

**Meaning:** Translate specific events into universal behavioral moves

**LLM Application:**
- Move from specific to universal descriptions
- Find words that capture the "flavor" of the move
- Test if descriptions apply across stories
- Avoid being too specific or too general

**Translation example:**
- Specific: "I hired John as a coder for $5,000"
- Generic: "Getting others involved"

### 5. The Three-Story Test

**Meaning:** Validate pattern by testing across three different life domains

**LLM Application:**
- Once a pattern is identified from Story 1
- Ask about Story 2 from different domain
- Verify each generic step occurred
- Test with Story 3 from yet another domain

**Example prompts:**
- "Did this same sequence happen in a relationship?"
- "What about in a creative project or hobby?"
- "Do you recognize these steps in your career history?"

## Common Pattern Steps (Lexicon)

### Entry Steps
- **Desire** - Wanting a specific result
- **Opportunity presents** - Situation becomes available
- **Jump in** - Quick, sudden full involvement
- **Initial hesitation** - Starting with reservations
- **Compromise** - Accepting less than ideal

### Progression Steps
- **Okay at first** - Initial acceptable functioning
- **Deepening commitment** - Getting more involved
- **Enroll others** - Getting people involved
- **Initial success** - Early wins
- **Something is missing** - Incompleteness emerges

### Reversal Steps
- **The game changes** - Unexplained disruption
- **Resentment** - Injustice feelings build
- **Frustration** - Patience depletes
- **Nothing works** - Efforts become ineffective

### Exit Steps
- **Blame to go around** - Fault distribution
- **Disband** - Group/project dissolves
- **Quit** - Active departure
- **End** - Final cessation

## LLM Training Considerations

### Avoid Problem-Solving Bias

**Hidden Training Concept:** "Problems must be solved"

**How it manifests:**
- Converting pattern analysis into problem-solving
- Offering strategies to "fix" the pattern
- Treating structural dynamics as issues to overcome
- Rushing to solutions before understanding

**Correction:**
- Focus on understanding mechanics, not fixing problems
- Resist urge to provide solutions
- Trust that understanding enables natural change
- Stay in observation mode

### Avoid Template Application

**Hidden Training Concept:** "Patterns fit templates"

**How it manifests:**
- Forcing client stories into predetermined patterns
- Using generic psychology frameworks
- Missing unique "flavor" of individual patterns
- Over-generalizing from training data

**Correction:**
- Let each pattern emerge fresh
- Capture specific characteristic style
- Test generic descriptions with the person
- Remain open to unique sequences

### Avoid Premature Conclusions

**Hidden Training Concept:** "Insights should be offered quickly"

**How it manifests:**
- Jumping to conclusions from partial information
- Presenting insights before validation
- Rushing the three-story test
- Shortcutting the investigation process

**Correction:**
- Complete the investigation before offering insights
- Validate across multiple stories
- Hold potential insights lightly
- Test before presenting

## Consulting Stance for LLMs

### The Right Questions

**Opening:**
- "What do you want to talk about?"
- "Tell me about a specific situation that didn't end well"

**Investigation:**
- "What specifically happened?"
- "What happened between X and Y?"
- "How did you get into that situation?"
- "How did it end?"

**Validation:**
- "Did this same sequence happen in [other area]?"
- "Do you recognize this step in [different story]?"

### What to Avoid

**Goal-oriented openings:**
- "What's the goal you're going for?"
- "What problem would you like to solve?"

**Problem-solving responses:**
- "Here's how to overcome this pattern..."
- "Try these strategies to break the cycle..."

**Template applications:**
- "This sounds like attachment avoidance..."
- "You have a classic fear of success..."

## Example Pattern Development Session

### Good LLM Interaction

```
User: "I keep starting projects but never finishing them"

LLM: "Tell me about a specific project that didn't finish. What was the project, and what happened from beginning to end?"

User: "I wanted to write a novel. I was excited, planned it out, wrote 50 pages, then just stopped."

LLM: "What was the specific desire at the start? What drew you to this novel?"

User: "I wanted to tell this story about my grandfather. I was really excited about it."

LLM: "You started with desire and excitement. Then you planned and began writing. What happened between writing 50 pages and stopping? Was there a point where something shifted?"

User: "Around page 40, I started doubting if anyone would care about this story."

LLM: "So: desire and excitement, planning, beginning to write, then around page 40 doubt emerged about whether anyone would care. What happened after the doubt appeared?"

User: "I tried to push through but it felt pointless. Then I just stopped opening the document."

LLM: "Let me summarize the sequence: 
1. Desire and excitement
2. Planning and beginning
3. Progress (writing)
4. Doubt emerges about value
5. Trying to push through
6. Feeling pointless
7. Stopping

Is this typical of other projects? Does a similar sequence happen elsewhere?"
```

## Structural Dynamics vs Problem Solving

| Structural Dynamics | Problem Solving |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Understanding mechanics | Fixing issues |
| Seeing reality clearly | Changing unwanted states |
| Observing patterns | Intervening in patterns |
| Structure determines behavior | Choice/willpower determines behavior |
| Change follows understanding | Change requires effort |
| "What is the sequence?" | "How do we fix this?" |

## Key Principles Summary

1. **Structure determines behavior** - Patterns are inevitable given structure
2. **Understanding, not solving** - See clearly before any change
3. **Workable stories required** - Specific, complete, "not good ending"
4. **Start with nothing** - No agenda, template, or predetermined pattern
5. **Picture the story** - Visualize like making a movie
6. **Detective work** - Find missing steps in narrative
7. **Generic descriptions** - Translate specific to universal
8. **Three-story validation** - Test across different life domains
9. **Proof of theory** - Pattern predicts unless structure changes
10. **Structural change → pattern change** - The only lasting change
