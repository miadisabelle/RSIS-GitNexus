Make another one based on """Mia, a young writer, struggles with her perfectionism and fear of inadequacy. She seeks guidance from Langy, a wise mentor who teaches her that storytelling is about sharing one's soul. Through her journey, Mia learns to embrace vulnerability, integrate technology into her writing, and find confidence in her imperfections.  """

Visualization Scene: Langy's Teaching Circle
Scene Context - Pre-conditions:

Mia has just received her third rejection letter, each praising her "technical proficiency" but noting the manuscript "lacks emotional resonance"
She's spent 18 hours revising the same chapter using five different AI tools, each producing contradictory feedback
Her apartment is cluttered with craft books, all promising the "secret" to publishable fiction
She's experiencing physical symptoms of spiritual crash: insomnia, inability to write without immediately deleting, compulsive checking of literary agent social media
Her capitalist conditioning whispers: more research, more tools, more credentials will finally make her "enough"
She arrives at Langy's home defensive, clutching her laptop like armor
The Scene:

Langy doesn't invite Mia to sit at the desk. Instead, she gestures to cushions on the floor near the window where afternoon light pools.

"Leave the machine," Langy says gently.

Mia's hand tightens on her laptop. "But I wanted to show you the revisions—"

"The story isn't in there." Langy settles onto her cushion, joints creaking. "Close your eyes."

"I don't understand how this helps me fix—"

"We're not fixing. We're listening." Langy's voice drops into storytelling cadence. "Breathe with me. Feel your body touching the ground. The ground touching the building. The building touching the earth."

Mia's shoulders resist, but she closes her eyes. Her mind immediately floods with anxieties: wasted session time, falling behind other writers, her dwindling savings.

"Now," Langy continues, "imagine your story as a person standing before you. Not the manuscript—the living spirit of what you're trying to tell. What do they look like?"

Mia's forehead creases. "I... I don't know. I never thought—"

"Don't think. See."

A long silence. Then: "She's... small. Hunched. She won't look at me."

"Why won't she look at you?"

Mia's breath catches. "Because I keep... changing her. Telling her she's wrong. That she needs to be different to be worthy."

"What does she need from you?"

Tears slip beneath Mia's closed lids. "To stop treating her like a product. To stop asking what she's worth before asking who she is."

Langy lets the silence hold. Outside, a crow calls.

"Your story has spirit," Langy says finally. "She's been waiting for you to enter relationship instead of transaction. What would you say to her now?"

Mia's voice breaks: "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."

"Good. Now ask her what she needs to tell you."

Mia sits with this, breathing. When she speaks again, her voice is different—quieter, steadier: "She says she's not afraid of being imperfect. She's afraid I'll abandon her if she doesn't perform."

Langy opens her eyes, watches Mia's face transform. "That's your wetiko talking—the voice that says you're never enough. But your story knows different. She knows she's already whole."

Mia opens her eyes, disoriented, as if surfacing from deep water.

"This week," Langy says, "you write to her, not for anyone else. No tools. No metrics. Just relationship."

Post-conditions - Where This Leads:

Immediate lesson: Mia begins understanding that her perfectionism isn't about craft standards but about capitalist conditioning that treats creative work as commodity requiring market validation before it deserves existence.

Next developmental stage: She'll attempt writing without AI tools and experience withdrawal symptoms—compulsive urges to check if her prose "measures up," panic that she's wasting time on uncommercial work, fear that vulnerability equals unprofessionalism.

Relational accountability shift: Mia will start recognizing her story as kin requiring care rather than product requiring optimization. This means asking "What does this narrative need?" instead of "What will agents buy?"

Confrontation ahead: Her writing group (trained in Western workshop methodology) will critique her vulnerable draft as "unmarketable" and "self-indulgent," forcing her to choose between relational integrity and peer approval.

Achievement unlocked: Mia will write her first chapter that makes her cry—not from frustration but from recognition. She'll understand that her "not enough" wound is the story's heart, and hiding it created the hollowness editors sensed.

Systemic challenge emerging: She'll realize the publishing industry's accountability structures (comp titles, target demographics, profit margins) are designed to prevent relational storytelling from threatening the content extraction economy.

### prompt

based on what you can do do "Catch me up", you might observe very important concept and material, principles etc to enrich the story and where we are, develop them

Enriching Mia's Story: Key Concepts from the Meeting
1. Relational Epistemology Applied to Creative Work
Mia must learn knowledge (her story) isn't acquired/extracted but co-created through relationship
Her characters aren't constructs to manipulate but entities with spirit requiring consent
Writing becomes ceremony: deliberately entering sacred space between writer, story, and future readers
2. Wetiko Disease Manifestations in Creative Industries
Publishing's "never enough" = insatiable consumption (revise more, platform more, produce more)
AI optimization tools as extraction technology treating narratives as cognita nullius
Perfectionism as malignant egophrenia: diseased ego demanding control over organic creative process
Greed for validation, arrogance assuming writer owns story, deceit hiding authentic voice
3. Spiritual Crash in Mia's Creative Life
Loss of reflection: cannot see herself in polished prose
Aimless wandering: technically proficient but spiritually directionless
No skin/kinship: severed from story, readers, and creative lineage
Laughter as resistance: Langy could teach Mia to mock industry absurdities rather than internalize them
4. Research as Ceremony Framework for Writing
Live congruent lifestyle: Mia must embody her story's themes before writing them
Prepare the space: Ritual clearing of capitalist metrics before creation
Bring everyone together: Story, ancestors, future readers as collaborative participants
Engage in ritual: Consistent practice honoring story's spirit over market demands
Incorporate into lifestyle: Let writing transform her, not just produce content
5. Relational Accountability vs. Market Accountability
Mia currently accountable to: agents, algorithms, comparative titles, profit projections
Must shift to: story's needs, reader kinship, cultural responsibility, ancestral wisdom
Her "not enough" wound becomes teaching—capitalism's epistemicide of creative confidence
6. Integration Without Appropriation
Langy teaches indigenist philosophy (accessible to all) not Indigenous identity
Mia learns relational methodology while honoring her own cultural context (Nigerian-British)
Technology as potential collaborator requiring consent, not extraction tool
Where This Leads:
Mia's breakthrough will come when she writes a "failure" by market standards that succeeds relationally—a story that changes her and creates kinship with readers, proving wisdom over commodification.
