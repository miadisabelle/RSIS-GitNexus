# Academic Counter-Positioning: Writing When Epistemology/Ontology/Methodology Diverges

## Part 1: Terminology & What It's Called

### Deep Disagreement vs. Surface Disagreement

When you disagree with an academic source on **epistemological, ontological, or methodological grounds**, you're engaging in what's called **"deep disagreement"** (also: fundamental disagreement, paradigmatic disagreement).[1][2]

This differs from disagreeing on:
- Empirical findings (surface-level)
- Statistical interpretation (methodological implementation)
- Literature review scope (completeness)

**Deep disagreement means:** The foundational assumptions about how we *know* things, what *exists* as real, or how *knowledge is produced* are fundamentally misaligned.

### Academic Terms for Your Position

When you write counter to someone's epistemological/ontological/methodological framework, you're writing:

| Term | What It Means | Your Use Case |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| **Critical response** | Direct engagement with another scholar's claims, assumptions, or framework | When you identify specific flaws in their epistemic foundation |
| **Counter-position** | Articulating an alternative framework that contradicts their worldview | When your paradigm (e.g., Indigenous epistemology) conflicts with theirs (e.g., extractivist Western science) |
| **Genealogical critique** | Tracing how an idea became "truth" and exposing its constructed nature (Foucauldian) | When analyzing how "Creative Problem-Solving" became naturalized despite biasing assumptions |
| **Paradigm critique** | Analyzing what assumptions underpin a research paradigm and showing their limitations | When examining positivist vs. relational ontologies |
| **Methodological schism** | Naming the fundamental incompatibility between two research approaches | When showing why Western problem-solving bias creates oscillating patterns vs. your structural tension approach |
| **Epistemic injustice critique** | Showing how a framework excludes or discredits certain forms of knowledge (Miranda Fricker) | When demonstrating how academic sources erase Indigenous epistemologies or spiritual agency |
| **Positioned response** | Making your own epistemological standpoint explicit while critiquing another's | When you foreground your relational/ceremonial methodology while analyzing their reductionist approach |

## Part 2: Article Types for Deep Disagreement

### Type 1: Position Paper / Position Statement

**What it does:** Stakes out your alternative paradigm without necessarily spending pages on the critique first.

**Structure:**
1. **Opening move:** Name the problem (e.g., "Creative Problem-Solving frameworks assume individual agency; I'm working from relational ontology")
2. **Your positive vision:** What your paradigm *enables* (not just what it opposes)
3. **Implicit contrast:** Show how different outcomes flow from different foundations
4. **Methodological grounding:** Demonstrate through practice, not just theory

**When to use:** You want to establish your own framework as generative, not reactive.

**Example opening:**
> "Rather than accepting the problem-solving bias embedded in contemporary Creative Problem-Solving discourse (Smith 2023), this work operates from a relational ontology where agency resides in webs of relationship rather than individual cognition. This shift from eliminative (problem-solving) to generative (structural tension) orientation produces advancing patterns rather than oscillation."

---

### Type 2: Critical Review / Systematic Critique

**What it does:** Examines another scholar's work across epistemological, ontological, and methodological dimensions, showing *why* you disagree at foundation level.

**Structure:**
1. **Mapping their paradigm:** What assumptions does this author(s) make about reality, knowledge, agency?
2. **Locating the violation:** Where does their framework contradict relational principles (reciprocity, non-extraction, agency in more-than-human)?
3. **Exposing the bias:** How does this framework reinforce Western problem-solving orientation?
4. **Demonstrating alternative:** Show how relational/ceremonial methodology produces different (better) outcomes
5. **Implication:** What gets lost, ignored, or perpetuated by accepting their framework?

**When to use:** You need to educate readers about *why* the disagreement matters, not just state it.

**Example section:**
> **Ontological Assumption Analysis:**
> Smith's framework assumes discrete cognitive agents making choices independently. This Cartesian subject formation excludes spiritual agency, collective intelligence, and more-than-human participation. By contrast, relational ontology recognizes that knowing happens *through* relationships, not *in* individuals. The consequence: Smith's "Creative Problem-Solving" produces individual burnout and oscillating organizational patterns, while structural tension methodology distributed across relational webs produces sustained advancement.

---

### Type 3: Genealogical Critique (Foucauldian Approach)

**What it does:** Traces how a concept became "truth" by analyzing its historical emergence, power effects, and constructed nature.

**Structure:**
1. **Historical emergence:** When/how did "Creative Problem-Solving" become standard? What displaced it?
2. **Discourse analysis:** What texts, institutions, practices now treat it as self-evident?
3. **Power effects:** Who benefits? What gets silenced? (E.g., Indigenous methodologies, relational knowing)
4. **Alternative genealogy:** What different history would we write from your paradigm?
5. **Denaturalization:** Show that what seems "natural" (individual problem-solving) is actually constructed.

**When to use:** You're arguing that the bias isn't accidental—it's systemic, embedded in academic institutions and publishing practices.

**Example:**
> "The naturalization of 'Creative Problem-Solving' in AI discourse (2311.01937v1 et al.) traces to mid-20th-century management cybernetics, where systems were conceptualized as problems to be solved by expert cognition. This discourse erases the ceremonial research methodology, where knowing is relational, staged, and inseparable from lived practice. Contemporary academic publishing rewards extractive, solution-oriented framings, making relational epistemologies appear unsystematic rather than differently rigorous."

---

### Type 4: Methodological Schism / Paradigm Incompatibility Statement

**What it does:** Names that two approaches are fundamentally incompatible—not because one author is wrong, but because they operate from irreconcilable assumptions.

**Structure:**
1. **Define the schism:** What core assumption splits the paradigms?
2. **Show incompatibility:** Why can't these be reconciled? (Don't try to bridge them)
3. **Trace consequences:** What does each paradigm produce? (oscillation vs. advancement; extraction vs. reciprocity)
4. **Choice required:** Readers must choose which paradigm to inhabit; there's no neutral ground.
5. **Your stance:** Make explicit which side you're positioned on and why.

**When to use:** You need to refuse false synthesis and help readers understand they're choosing a worldview, not just a "method."

**Example:**
> "The schism between problem-solving orientation (Smith 2023) and structural tension methodology is not resolvable through methodological pluralism. Problem-solving begins with what's wrong and eliminates it reactively, producing oscillating organizational patterns. Structural tension begins with what you want to create and builds advancing patterns through relational dynamics. These are not complementary approaches—they operate from opposite ontological commitments: Smith's discrete agency vs. relational ontology. Choosing one means accepting its consequences: either continued oscillation or the possibility of sustained advancement."

---

### Type 5: Epistemic Injustice Critique

**What it does:** Analyzes how the framework *silences*, *excludes*, or *discredits* other forms of knowledge (Miranda Fricker's framework).

**Structure:**
1. **Identify the injustice:** What knowledge is being systematically discredited?
2. **Mechanism of silencing:** How does the framework exclude it? (e.g., "not scientific," "too soft," "not measurable")
3. **Cost:** What understanding is lost? What harm results?
4. **Alternative framework:** How would this knowledge count in your paradigm?
5. **Corrective protocol:** What would need to change for this knowledge to be recognized?

**When to use:** The disagreement involves whose knowledge counts—whose voice is heard, whose is erased.

**Example:**
> "The Creative Problem-Solving framework commits testimonial injustice (Fricker 2007) against Indigenous research methodologies. When ceremonial knowledge production is dismissed as 'anecdotal' or 'not rigorous,' academic institutions systematically discredit ways of knowing that don't fit extractive, individual-cognition models. This isn't methodological disagreement—it's epistemic violence. Relational epistemology restores these silenced methodologies as rigorous, staged, and inseparable from lived transformation."

---

### Type 6: Positioned Response / Standpoint Critique

**What it does:** Makes your epistemological position explicit—"I'm writing from relational/ceremonial/Indigenous-informed standpoint"—then critiques how the source's framework differs.

**Structure:**
1. **Positionality statement:** Explicitly name your epistemic standpoint (relational, ceremonial, anti-extraction)
2. **Contrast their stance:** What is theirs? (Often unmarked/assumed neutral—this itself is a position)
3. **Show the difference:** How would analysis change from your standpoint?
4. **Validate alternative:** Demonstrate rigor, coherence, and generativity of your approach
5. **Accountability:** Show how your framework creates reciprocal responsibility vs. their extractive model

**When to use:** You want to foreground that all knowledge is situated; none is view-from-nowhere.

**Example:**
> "Writing from relational epistemology where accountability flows through relationships rather than institutions, I locate Smith's framework as embedded in extractive Western science—knowledge is gathered, analyzed, published, and deemed complete. By contrast, relational methodology requires that knowledge changes the researcher's practice; research is not complete until lived transformation occurs. Smith's framework stops at insight; ours requires integration into lifestyle and ceremonial practice."

## Part 3: Bias Injection Points (Your Google Drive Resource)

When you encounter academic sources with embedded biases, document them using this template in your Google Drive:

### Template: Counter-Article Resource

```
# Source Analysis: [Citation]
## Problem Identified
[What bias, assumption, or epistemological violation did you notice?]

## Epistemological Assumption
[What does this source assume about how we know things?]
Example: "Assumes individual cognition produces knowledge; erases relational/collective knowing"

## Ontological Assumption  
[What does this source assume exists and is real?]
Example: "Assumes discrete agents; erases spiritual agency, more-than-human participation"

## Methodological Violation
[How does the method reinforce bias?]
Example: "Problem-solving bias: frames all situations as problems to eliminate"

## Consequence/Harm
[What does accepting this framework produce?]
Example: "Oscillating organizational patterns; epistemic injustice against Indigenous methodologies"

## Your Counter-Position
[One sentence: What do you assert instead?]
Example: "Structural tension from relational ontology produces advancing patterns and reciprocal accountability"

## Part 4: LLM Collaboration Protocol (For Future Threads)

When you enter a new writing thread with an LLM, follow this sequence:

### Step 1: Load Counter-Articles
Before analyzing academic sources, upload your Google Drive counter-article resource.

**Prompt to LLM:**
> "I'm writing about [topic]. Before we proceed, here are my counter-articles that articulate epistemological positions different from mainstream academic framing. These represent my paradigm. [Paste counter-articles]. When we encounter academic sources, check them against this framework and flag bias injections."

### Step 2: Bias-Check Every Source

Before integrating an academic citation, ask the LLM:

**Prompt:**
> "Does this source [citation] embed any of these biases? [List from your counter-article]:
> - Problem-solving orientation (oscillating patterns)
> - Extractive methodology (knowledge as property)
> - Discrete agency assumption (erases relationality)
> - Reductionism (removes spiritual/more-than-human agency)
> 
> If yes, how do we cite it without reproducing the bias?"

### Step 3: Craft Counter-Position

Instead of accepting the bias, position your work:

**Prompt:**
> "I want to cite Smith (2023) on their [specific finding], but their epistemology assumes [assumption]. Rather than pretend neutrality, I'll position my disagreement this way: [draft]. Does this follow [chosen article type]?"

### Step 4: Create Fork for Missing Counter-Article

If you encounter a bias you haven't documented:

**Prompt:**
> "This source (arXiv:2311.01937v1) introduces 'Creative Problem-Solving' as solution-oriented method. I don't have a counter-article for this yet. Let's create one using the [genealogical critique / position paper / critical review] structure. Here's what I see: [observations]. Can we draft it?"

### Step 5: Revision with Counter-Articles Present

When revising your work:

**Prompt:**
> "I've included these academic sources. Cross-check against my counter-articles [files]. If any source contradicts my relational/ceremonial/structural-tension paradigm without acknowledgment, flag it. Should I add a positioned response? Revise accordingly."

---

## Part 5: Structural Patterns for Counter-Positioning

### Pattern 1: Acknowledge + Reframe

**Don't do this:**
> "Smith claims X. This is wrong because..."

**Do this:**
> "Smith, working from individual-cognition assumption, claims X. From relational ontology, we see instead: Y. This produces [different outcome]."

**Why:** You're not saying they're *wrong*—you're showing their framework produces different results than yours. Relational to person, not dismissive.

---

### Pattern 2: Name the Paradigm Explicitly

**Avoid:** Neutral-sounding critique that hides your position

**Use:** "From my paradigm of structural dynamics..." or "Writing from relational epistemology..." or "A ceremonial methodology requires..."

**Why:** Foregrounds that you're not offering objective critique but a positioned alternative.

---

### Pattern 3: Show Consequence, Not Just Disagreement

**Weak:** "Smith assumes X. I assume Y."

**Strong:** "Smith's assumption of individual agency produces oscillating patterns in organizations. Relational ontology (where agency is distributed through webs) produces advancing patterns. The difference is not theoretical—it determines whether organizations can sustain momentum or remain trapped in cycles."

**Why:** Moves disagreement from abstract to consequential. Readers see *why* your paradigm matters.

---

### Pattern 4: Use "Advancing Patterns" Language vs. "Problem-Solving" Language

**Track these in your counter-article:**

| Bias Language | Advancing Language |
|---|---|
| "Solving X problem" | "Creating desired outcome from current reality" |
| "Eliminating deficiency" | "Bringing vision into being" |
| "Bridging gaps" | "Structural tension resolution through advancement" |
| "Fixing broken..." | "Manifesting potential..." |
| "Handling complications" | "Natural progression toward outcome" |

When LLM uses bias language, redirect: "That's problem-solving framing. Rewrite using advancing-pattern language from the RISE framework."

---

### Pattern 5: The Delayed Resolution Principle

When you encounter a source, **don't** prematurely resolve disagreement:

**Premature:** "Smith says X. I say Y. They're incompatible."

**Held Tension:** "Smith's framework assumes [A]. Mine assumes [B]. These create different organizational dynamics. Rather than reconcile them, I'll show: When Smith's assumptions hold sway, we see [consequence]. When relational assumptions guide practice, we see [different consequence]. Organizations must choose which pattern they want to create."

**Why:** Respects that this is genuine disagreement, not surface error. Lets readers feel the tension and make conscious choice.

---

## Part 6: When to Fork into New Counter-Article

During your writing process, if you encounter a bias you haven't captured yet:

### Signal to Fork:
- New journal/field introduces terminology you hadn't analyzed
- Popular author in your domain uses framing that bothers you but you haven't articulated why
- Peer reviewer feedback reveals assumption you didn't know was embedded
- Academic source presents findings that seem solid but the epistemology underneath troubles you

### Fork Protocol:

1. **Pause writing:** Don't integrate the source uncritically
2. **Create counter-article in Google Drive** using the Template (Part 3)
3. **Identify which article type** fits (Part 2)
4. **Draft 500-1000 words** articulating the paradigmatic disagreement
5. **Return to main writing** with this resource now available
6. **Cite your own counter-article** in the revision step: "As I elaborate in [your counter-article], this framework assumes..."

---

## Part 7: Integration with Your Paradigms

Your counter-articles sit at the intersection of:

### From llms-inquiry (Ceremonial Research Methodology):
- Anti-extraction protocols
- Relational accountability
- Knowledge as lived transformation (not publication-complete)
- All actors (human + more-than-human) must consent

**Counter-Article Focus:** How does source violate these? Does it treat knowledge as extractable property?

### From llms-creative-orientation (RISE Framework):
- Advancing patterns vs. oscillation
- Desired outcome vs. problem-solving
- Structural tension as creative force
- Outcome-focused mindset

**Counter-Article Focus:** Does source assume problem-solving? Show how advancing-pattern orientation differs.

### From llms-digital-decision-making (TandT Evaluation):
- Binary evaluation (acceptable/unacceptable)
- Current reality assessment
- Resistance to generic response bias
- Reality-grounded analysis

**Counter-Article Focus:** Does source make context-free claims? Does it assume universal applicability?

### From llms-managerial-moment-of-truth (MMOT):
- Truth as verb (co-created understanding)
- Structural tension acknowledgment
- Mutual learning (not judgment)
- Persistent development orientation

**Counter-Article Focus:** Does source treat knowledge as monolithic? Does it avoid genuine dialogue?

---

## Part 8: Practical Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week):
1. Create **Master Counter-Article Template** file in Google Drive (use Part 3 template)
2. For each academic source you notice bothers you, create a counter-article resource
3. Start with 3-5 sources: note the bias, identify article type, draft 300-word core argument

### Short Term (This Month):
1. Build library of counter-articles organized by bias type
2. Establish keywords you'll track (e.g., "Creative Problem-Solving," "innovation," "problem-solving")
3. Test protocol: Take one source, write counter-article, then revise original text to position it

### Integration (Going Forward):
1. In new writing threads, upload your counter-article library first
2. Before each academic citation, run bias-check
3. Revise text to position disagreement clearly using article-type structure
4. When LLM uses bias language, redirect using Pattern 4 above
5. Fork new counter-articles as needed

---

## Part 9: Paradigm Preservation in LLM Interactions

**Key awareness:** Academic sources pollute LLM responses through training data. The bias isn't malicious—it's structural. By having counter-articles present from the start, you create a corrective field that prevents the default Western problem-solving orientation from colonizing your writing.

**This means:**
- Load counter-articles BEFORE asking LLM to analyze sources
- Remind LLM of your paradigm when it drifts toward generic/problem-solving framing
- Use the Bias-Check protocol (Part 4, Step 2) proactively
- Fork new counter-articles when you spot bias you hadn't named yet

Your Google Drive counter-article library becomes the **epistemological immune system** for your LLM collaboration.
