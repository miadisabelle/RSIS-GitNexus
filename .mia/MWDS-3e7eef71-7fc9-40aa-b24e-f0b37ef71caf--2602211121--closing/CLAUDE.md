# CLAUDE

* I dont know the naming of this type of session with an LLM, for sure, the amount of sessions and what I am doing seems not to fit in my brain... thought I am capable to assemble the various parts for LLM to help me

## Outcomes

* Clarity of what we would have as Human and AI Companion when we have all that is implied in this session

## files

### Intermediary Schema for this type of session

* I am thinking of creating our own .csv files from `paths.txt` and `charts.txt` with you claude which would simply be a first steps when doing the context-engineering of this session.  paths.csv and charts.csv would be created with a simple sets of columns that would tell human and LLM about these path and still, human can add more path to paths.txt and charts.txt and LLM update paths.csv and charts.csv enabling a startup of relationship based on what you will understand bellow.

### `sessions.csv`

* A small schema I just created for sessions that will work with this one

### `paths.txt`

* Path for this session which has the purpose to go thru all the related path and see where we are.  
* Deeply related to `charts.txt` which will contain the various 'coaia-narrative' charts used by agents


### `charts.txt`

* various 'coaia-narrative' charts used by agents in various path
* We would develop a way to consolidate them.
* I know I was on the verge to decide to implement into `/src/mcp-medicine-wheel` our own implementation of the tools `/src/coaia-narrative` offers, thought I am questionning here that the "Medicine Wheel" developper are making could have all the charts path and a consolidating view of all of them could be what we see in `/src/mcp-medicine-wheel-ui` and therefore that would influence what we are developping in `/workspace/repos/jgwill/medicine-wheel/src` for some highly and carefully thought thru package that enable what coaia-narrative todo (note that it was made up from extending a knowledge-graph-memory, therefore, there surely something that can connect to onlologies, epistemologies or methodologies because in a way, charts contains what we know about what we truely want to create (or at least, the consolidation would be a practice human/AI that would lead to that, giving larger sense to each charts and sessions that are part of the Kinship's hub....)
#### `sessiondata.charts.txt`

* Listed all coaia-narrative charts from the claude hooks session folder, not knowing if they relate or not, they should be looked, understood and potentially included in the `charts.csv` data
* Why charts in these folders ? Sometime, not knowing or being in observation of another session, chart get created and often another agent observe another  which is something we will consider doing when we work with our own terminal agent such as `/src/mia-code` and `/src/Miadi-18/miadi-code` (which might become the same agent later on).

## `.mia/kinship/KINSHIP.list.txt` and `.mia/kinship/MISSIONS.list.txt`

* Create toward Kinship path that we might have relationship with in here (or not).
* `/src/llms/llms-kinship-hub-system.md` describes this idea of Kinship (thought it might need revision, I dont know, maybe the file `/src/llms/llms-inquiry-6406eb37-69b1-471d-9cac-07ae69449c35.md` would help understand the potential modulation with 'structural tension charts' and the Medicine-Wheel (which contains, obviously, the Kinship's principle that we are just starting to experiment here...)

* Describe a coaia-narrative that we would work with for this session and its purpose
