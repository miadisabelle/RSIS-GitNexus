### Working sense of “knowledge stewardship” here

In the Q3 option, “Community-based/ceremonial work and knowledge stewardship” signals a long‑term role where you are:

- Answerable first to specific peoples, places, and ancestors rather than to an abstract “field”.
- Taking responsibility for how knowledge (including digital/data forms) lives, moves, changes, and is protected over time.
- Acting as a kaitiaki/guardian of relationships between people, land, ancestors, stories, and the infrastructures (archives, platforms, AI systems, ceremonies) through which these relationships are engaged.

In Indigenous research discourse, “stewardship” is used to distinguish accountable guardianship from extractive ownership or neutral “management”: institutions and researchers must hold Indigenous knowledge in ways that protect cultural wellbeing, maintain Indigenous authority over how it is used, and avoid converting it into decontextualised “data”.[^1_1][^1_2]

In a Q3 sense, this is not just being an archivist or librarian of content; it is an ongoing ceremonial, ethical, relational role that shapes how knowledge circulates and who it serves.

***

### Epistemology of knowledge stewardship

*(what counts as knowledge and how knowledge is understood)*

1. **Knowledge as relationships, not objects**
    - Wilson’s paradigm frames Indigenous epistemology as fundamentally relational: “we are the relationships that we hold and are a part of,” and research is ceremony to improve those relationships.[^1_3][^1_4]
    - Knowledge stewardship, then, is about tending to these relationships (with land, spirits, kin, data, stories, tools) so that they remain healthy and life‑supporting, rather than curating static “content”.
2. **Collective, situated, and place‑anchored**
    - Knowledge is held collectively (whānau, hapū, iwi, nation, kin network) and is inseparable from place, language, and practice.[^1_1]
    - Stewardship involves guarding against “bleeding of knowledge away from collective protection through individual participation in research,” as Linda Tuhiwai Smith puts it in relation to extractive research logics.[^1_1]
3. **Living knowledge systems**
    - Indigenous knowledge is treated as dynamic and intergenerational; stewardship includes enabling ongoing transmission, not just “preserving” what exists now.[^1_5][^1_6]
    - Arts‑based, participatory, and community‑led processes (ceremony, storytelling, performance, participatory video, etc.) are themselves epistemic practices that keep knowledge alive.[^1_7][^1_8]

***

### Ontology of knowledge stewardship

*(what exists and what you are in relation with)*

1. **Relational ontology**
    - Wilson and others articulate an ontology where entities are defined by relationships rather than essences: land–water–people–nonhumans–stories–technologies form a mesh of relations.[^1_4][^1_1]
    - “Stewardship” therefore concerns a whole relational field (watersheds, species, community protocols, data infrastructures, AI models) rather than a single object like “a database” or “a ceremony”.
2. **Knowledge as a being / relative**
    - Some Indigenous framings treat knowledge (or particular stories, songs, atua, or data corpora) as relatives with whom one has obligations, not just resources.[^1_9][^1_1]
    - Knowledge stewardship, in this ontological frame, is closer to caring for a living being or lineage than curating an artefact.
3. **Governance entities and sovereignty**
    - Data and knowledge linked to Indigenous territories and communities fall under Indigenous governance and data sovereignty: the right to “maintain, control, protect and develop” cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and intellectual property.[^1_10][^1_11]
    - Stewardship roles are ontologically tied to Indigenous polities (iwi, First Nations, tribes) and their legal, spiritual, and political authority, not just to disciplinary communities.

***

### Methodology of knowledge stewardship

*(how one works, including protocols and practices)*

1. **Relational accountability as core method**
    - Wilson’s “relational accountability” defines methodology as being responsible to all your relations—how you choose topics, methods, analysis, and dissemination.[^1_12][^1_13]
    - Stewardship methodologically means designing every step of research, design, and data practice to uphold respect, reciprocity, and responsibility to specific communities and lands.
2. **Indigenous data governance and sovereignty**
    - Frameworks such as Indigenous Data Sovereignty, OCAP, CARE, and Māori data sovereignty emphasize that Indigenous peoples must govern collection, framing, storage, access, and reuse of data about their lands, peoples, and knowledges.[^1_11][^1_14][^1_10]
    - Knowledge stewardship here is operationalised as:
        - Establishing governance protocols (who can authorize what, when, and how).
        - Creating consent and dissent pathways (the right to decline participation or revoke permissions at any stage).[^1_1]
        - Ensuring local custodianship and benefit‑sharing mechanisms.
3. **Indigenous knowledge stewardship in institutions**
    - Work on knowledge stewardship in seed banks proposes four interrelated dimensions of institutional accountability to Indigenous knowledge:
        - **Relational** (ongoing engagement with communities, not one‑off consent).
        - **Procedural** (clear protocols, agreements, and review).
        - **Substantive** (actual outcomes that protect and enhance Indigenous wellbeing).
        - **Contextual** (sensitivity to specific histories, cultural logics, and power relations).[^1_2]
    - For your context, the same logic applies to archives, AI training data, creative repositories, or ceremonial recordings.
4. **Co‑production and knowledge‑bridging**
    - Newer models of “relational science” and knowledge co‑production centre Indigenous values and co‑design across all stages of research to support Indigenous stewardship of data and knowledge.[^1_15][^1_1]
    - Methodologically this often involves:
        - Long‑term partnerships with Indigenous-led institutions.
        - Youth and Elder co‑research roles.
        - Multi‑modal outputs (reports, calendars, visualisations, artistic works) that are controlled and credited to local knowledge holders.[^1_5][^1_1]
5. **Ceremony as method**
    - In Wilson’s paradigm, research is ceremony; ceremony is a method for establishing and renewing relationships that make knowledge possible.[^1_3][^1_4]
    - A knowledge stewardship orientation gives ceremony methodological priority: openings/closings, karakia, talking circles, land‑based practices, and seasonal cycles are not “add‑ons” but core methods that govern when, how, and whether knowledge can move.

***

### Axiology of knowledge stewardship

*(what values are foregrounded and what “good” looks like)*

1. **Core value set: Respect, Reciprocity, Responsibility, Relationality**
    - Wilson’s three R’s—Respect, Reciprocity, Relationality—extended into “relational accountability” provide the axiological core.[^1_12][^1_4]
    - In a stewardship orientation, “good” practice is that which:
        - Honors kinship and consent.
        - Gives back concretely (not just through citation but through resources, infrastructures, and power‑sharing).
        - Deepens and strengthens relationships over time.
2. **Collective benefit and self‑determination**
    - CARE and related frameworks emphasise that Indigenous data and knowledge practices should deliver **collective benefit**, uphold **authority to control**, ensure **responsibility**, and adhere to **ethics** defined by Indigenous communities.[^1_14][^1_11]
    - Stewardship ethics thus measure success by whether communities retain or gain control, and whether knowledge use advances self‑determination.
3. **Protection from harm and “bleeding away”**
    - Values include guarding against epistemic extraction, misrepresentation, and misuse, especially in digital and AI contexts.[^1_16][^1_1]
    - Stewardship axiology views refusal, opacity, and partial sharing as legitimate ethical strategies, not as deficits.
4. **For life / kawsaypaq framing**
    - Some Indigenous methodologies explicitly frame research as “for life” (kawsaypaq)—research that protects and restores good relations with earth, waters, and beings.[^1_17]
    - Knowledge stewardship aligned with this axiology orients knowledge practices toward the flourishing of communities and ecosystems, not just scholarly advancement.

### Sketching a knowledge graph around “knowledge stewardship”

Think in terms of a conceptual graph where “knowledge stewardship” sits as a central node connected across epistemology–ontology–methodology–axiology:

- **Central node:**
    - *Knowledge stewardship*
- **Epistemic neighbours (what knowledge is):**
    - *Relational knowledge* → “knowledge as relationships” (Wilson)[^1_4]
    - *Collective knowledge* → whānau/hapū/iwi, nations, communities
    - *Living knowledge systems* → ILK, TEK, dynamic, intergenerational[^1_5]
- **Ontological neighbours (what exists):**
    - *Relations network* → land–water–people–nonhumans–stories–technologies[^1_1]
    - *Knowledge beings/relatives* → stories, songs, data sets as entities to whom obligations are owed
    - *Governance entities* → iwi, First Nations, tribal governments, urban Indigenous collectives, Indigenous‑led institutions[^1_10][^1_11]
- **Methodological neighbours (how work is done):**
    - *Relational accountability* → topic choice, methods, analysis, outputs all answerable to relations[^1_13][^1_12]
    - *Indigenous data governance* → OCAP, CARE, IDS principles operationalised in data flows and platforms[^1_11][^1_14][^1_10]
    - *Knowledge co‑production / Two‑Eyed Seeing* → bridging Indigenous and Western knowledge while maintaining Indigenous authority[^1_18][^1_1]
    - *Ceremonial protocols* → methods of opening/closing, consent, timing, and seasonality (Wilson, Kaupapa Māori tikanga)[^1_4][^1_1]
- **Axiological neighbours (values and ethics):**
    - *Respect / Reciprocity / Responsibility* → guiding values in all interactions[^1_12][^1_4]
    - *Collective benefit \& self‑determination* → CARE, OCAP, UNDRIP 31[^1_14][^1_11]
    - *Protection and refusal* → mechanisms to prevent harm, misappropriation, and “bleeding away” of knowledge[^1_2][^1_1]
- **Applied domains / roles:**
    - *Community knowledge keeper / kaitiaki* → ceremonial and governance roles in community.
    - *Institutional steward* → designing archives, repositories, and policies that respect Indigenous knowledge stewardship.[^1_19][^1_2]
    - *Digital/AI steward* → shaping datasets, models, platforms to align with Indigenous data sovereignty and relational ethics.[^1_20][^1_16][^1_14]

### Reading Q3: “community-based/ceremonial work and knowledge stewardship” through this lens

Within the choice set you were given, selecting Q3 in this meaning‑space signals that your long‑term direction is:

- Grounded primarily in **community and ceremonial obligations**, with research, media, and AI as tools in service of those obligations, not the other way around.
- Oriented toward **governing the life of knowledge** (including data and AI systems) in ways that safeguard Indigenous sovereignty, relationality, and future generations, rather than mainly advancing an academic field or commercial innovations.[^1_11][^1_14][^1_1]
- Positioned as a **steward/kaitiaki** at the intersection of:
    - Indigenous research paradigms (Kaupapa Māori, Wilson’s relational paradigm).
    - Community and ceremonial spaces (marae, land‑based gatherings, healing/rite contexts).
    - Infrastructures of knowledge (archives, community servers, media platforms, AI pipelines).

Relative to the other Q3 options:

- **Academic research and teaching** → prioritises universities as the primary site of impact; stewardship may still occur but is often mediated by institutional constraints.
- **Industry/innovation (AI, media, creative tech)** → prioritises building systems/products; stewardship is often subordinated to innovation logics unless explicitly re‑centred.
- **Hybrid academic–industry–community** → spreads attention across sectors; stewardship is one of several concurrent roles.

“Community-based/ceremonial work and knowledge stewardship” centers the *guardian* function: designing and tending the protocols, infrastructures, and ceremonies by which Indigenous knowledge circulates, is protected, and is renewed—whether or not that happens inside formal academe or industry.
