# RCH-research-approach--Kaupapa-vs-Wilson--c3253477-df38-46bc-b663-03b402c9fc09--2602130314

Academic literature review of "Kaupapa Māori research approach" and "Research Is Ceremony" (Wilson) where you show commonalities and each of them particularity and on what research subject which approach would apply best.

* Some context to help you get what I am envisionning:
<context>
University of Waikato, New Zealand

Master’s degrees in Indigenous studies and art in New Zealand focus on Māori knowledge (mātauranga Māori), decolonizing practices, and creative expression. Key programs include the Master of Indigenous Studies at Te Whare Wānanga o Awanuiārangi, the University of Canterbury’s Master of Arts in Māori \& Indigenous Studies, and Massey University’s Master of Fine Arts (Creative Practice). These programs are designed for artists, educators, and community leaders aiming to integrate cultural identity with advanced research.

# MASTERS

## Arts Masters || Engineering Masters || Media and Creative Technologies Masters  // Science and Technologies Masters || Design Masters

</context>

<questions>
Questions I have are in which of these masters am I going to postulate ? I am thinking of doing more than one (as my old thesis director said if that would be todo it again, I would do more than one master degree at the same time (write more  than one thesis as I see this, we have perspectives on a subject that multiple-thesis can cover and because I am always confused when I do such work, I feel my tooling right now would assist me intelligently (with LLM) to shift perspectives and work on whatever that will be called.

the masters that university offers are : Arts Masters || Engineering Masters || Media and Creative Technologies Masters  // Science and Technologies Masters || Design Masters

 I guess you can search about them to give me what they are researching for and what I would learn and have todo in each of them and career perspectives so that with that I would be capable to choose which masters todo.
 


</questions>
Do not use the word 'comprehensive' in your output and do not talk about the fact that I asked that.  Do not introduce/frame or conclude your response, just output results.
Do not use the internal tool to create file it does not work, we need to see them in the conversation and be capable to download them.

1. Which primary orientation best matches what you want your thesis to do in the world?

- Transform Indigenous research/ceremonial practice itself (methods, protocols, paradigms)
- Design and build media/AI/storytelling systems grounded in Indigenous paradigms
- Work primarily as an artist/performer using Indigenous-informed creative practice
- Influence policy, institutions, or social programmes using Indigenous research

2. How important is it that your main supervisor and cohort be explicitly grounded in Indigenous methodologies (Kaupapa Māori, Wilson, etc.)?

- Non‑negotiable: I want an Indigenous methodologies‑centred programme
- Very important but I can sit in a more general programme if the supervisor fits
- Nice to have but not essential
- I am fine in a conventional programme and will carry the paradigm myself

3. What is your long-term direction after the degree(s)?

- Academic research and teaching
- Community-based/ceremonial work and knowledge stewardship
- Industry/innovation (AI, media, creative technology)
- Hybrid academic–industry–community role

You can reply in a compact way (for example: “Q1: 1 and 2, Q2: 1, Q3: 4”) or describe your own option if none of these fits.

# >Clarifying user's preferences between Indigenous methodologies and media-oriented master's paths to tailor the literature review.

I want to see what you were proposing (4 choices) I could not select the one that I wanted !!!

1. Which primary orientation best matches what you want your thesis to do in the world?

- Transform Indigenous research/ceremonial practice itself (methods, protocols, paradigms)
- Design and build media/AI/storytelling systems grounded in Indigenous paradigms
- Work primarily as an artist/performer using Indigenous-informed creative practice
- Influence policy, institutions, or social programmes using Indigenous research

2. How important is it that your main supervisor and cohort be explicitly grounded in Indigenous methodologies (Kaupapa Māori, Wilson, etc.)?

- Non‑negotiable: Indigenous methodologies‑centred programme
- Very important but possible to sit in a more general programme if the supervisor fits
- Nice to have but not essential
- Fine with a conventional programme and carrying the paradigm personally

3. What is your long-term direction after the degree(s)?

- Academic research and teaching
- Community-based/ceremonial work and knowledge stewardship
- Industry/innovation (AI, media, creative technology)
- Hybrid academic–industry–community role

Answer in shorthand if you like, e.g. `Q1: 1+2, Q2: 1, Q3: 4`.
