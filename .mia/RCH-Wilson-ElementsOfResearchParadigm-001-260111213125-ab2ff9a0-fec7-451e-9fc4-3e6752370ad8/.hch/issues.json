The reader must be able to comprehend the writer’s beliefs in order to see what the writer sees. When this is not happening, miscommunication is inevitable.\n\nSo in addition to explaining the aim of the book, this foreword explains a bit about how my logic works, the pattern my cultural style of communication follows, some of the terms of reference I use and my role in this process. As Terry Tafoya (1995) said, when speaking with people from another culture it often takes longer to explain the context, background or meaning of a story than it does to actually tell the story. On the other hand, when communicating with people who share the same culture, too much explanation or background detailing could be seen as disrespectful of the intelligence of the listener. Since I have no way of knowing if the reader is from the same culture as me, I hope I will be excused if I am being insensitive in this foreword. I come to you with a good heart.\n\nThis book describes one view of an Indigenous research paradigm, in the process answering the following questions:\n\n* What are the shared aspects of the ontology, epistemology, axiology and methodology of research conducted by Indigenous scholars in Australia and Canada?\n* How can these aspects of an Indigenous research paradigm be put into practice to support other Indigenous people in their own research?\n\nI put forward in the book that: 1. the shared aspect of an Indigenous ontology and epistemology is relationality (relationships do not merely shape reality, they *are* reality). The shared aspect of an Indigenous axiology and methodology is accountability to relationships. 2. The shared aspects of relationality and relational accountability can be put into practice through choice of research topic, methods of data collection, form of analysis and presentation of information.\n\nWhile this paradigm has developed from working with Indigenous scholars in Canada and Australia, it is by no means intended to be exclusive to these groups. Indigenous scholars from other countries and homelands (especially some phenomenal Native Hawaiians) have read this manuscript and taken part in discussions of our paradigms, as have many non-Indigenous academics, and have confirmed that their own worldviews are compatible. So I must apologize for leaving out any groups of peoples with my research questions. These were merely intended to provide some boundaries for the sake of my own research, not to limit the use of this paradigm. It is my hope that my continuing journey of learning in this area will allow me to incorporate the words of many more Indigenous scholars from around the world into this paradigm.\n\n--- [p. 13] ---\n\n# 1 Getting Started\n\nmillion times. The story that I want to tell you now has to do with being a student and a researcher (maybe even a scientist) and how I am able to be these things while holding my head up high and holding true to the ideals and culture I was raised in. It may be that hearing my story about being an Indigenous researcher will make it easier for you to carry your beliefs into whatever field you choose to pursue when you grow up.\n\nI am going to write about an Indigenous research paradigm: what it is, why it is important and what it means to me. It is through learning and living this paradigm that I assert my Indigeneity (if there is such a word) in the world of academics. Many people before me have written about the need for such a paradigm. I am not going to go over their arguments here—you can read them for yourself if you are interested. People such as Linda Smith, Lester Rigney and Fyre Jean Graveline have written about how Eurocentric research has helped in the colonization and oppression of our people. By standing on their shoulders for my justification, I want to go further and try to explain just how research can be different—can be Indigenous. It may be that by looking at the different aspects of an Indigenous research paradigm, we can both learn more about the bigger question of what it is to be Indigenous.\n\nIn order to tell this story, it may be necessary for me to use some pretty big and daunting words. I try hard not to use these words in everyday conversations, because I think that too many people use big language as a way of belittling others. However, some of the ideas I want you to understand require these words, as they are able to get across a lot of meaning. Our traditional language has words that contain huge amounts of information encoded like a ZIP file within them. The English language also has such words, so by helping to decode them for you, this story will be a lot more understandable. Perhaps a good place to begin is to explain to you just what a research paradigm is. A paradigm is a set of underlying beliefs that guide our actions. So a research paradigm is the beliefs that guide our actions as researchers. These beliefs include the way that we view reality (ontology), how we think about or know this reality (epistemology), our ethics and morals (axiology) and how we go about gaining more knowledge about reality (methodology). I am going to talk a lot more about the meaning of these words later.\n\nAn Indigenous research paradigm is made up of an Indigenous ontology, epistemology, axiology and methodology. These beliefs influence the tools we as researchers use in finding out more about the cosmos. Like myself, other Indigenous scholars have in the past tried to use the dominant research paradigms. We have tried to adapt dominant system research tools by including our perspective into their views. We have tried to include our cultures, traditional protocols and practices into the research process through adapting and adopting suitable methods. The problem with that is that we can never really remove the tools from their underlying beliefs. Since these beliefs are not always compatible with our own, we will always face problems in trying to adapt dominant system tools to our use. I hope that my articulating the aspects of an Indigenous research\n\n--- [p. 17] ---\n\nhealth. One consequence of such studies, even though their intentions may have been good, has been the proliferation of negative stereotypes about Indigenous communities.\n\nAnother, more subtle, problem with “outsiders” researching Indigenous peoples is that there is always a comparison made between the culture of the “studied” and that of the “studier.” The language, tone and focus of research reflects this comparison, with the inevitable consequence of rating of one over the other. As proponents of a holistic view of our worlds, Indigenous scholars may recognize the holistic approach to oppression that is evident in all of the ways that Indigenous peoples are held down by research and the dominant view of knowledge and the world is upheld. It is time for Indigenous peoples and Indigenous research to break free from the hegemony of the dominant system, into a place where we are deciding our own research agendas.\n\nIn her article about the paradox of Indigenous higher education, Heather Harris (2002) addresses the issue of hegemony with a Coyote story. Stories and metaphor are often used in Indigenous societies (not just in Canada and Australia but with other Indigenous peoples around the world) as a teaching tool. Stories allow listeners to draw their own conclusions and to gain life lessons from a more personal perspective. By getting away from abstractions and rules, stories allow us to see others’ life experiences through our own eyes. This information may then be internalized in a way that is difficult for abstract discussions to achieve. Harris’s story to me illustrates just how pervasive dominant system academics have been in guiding Indigenous research and the teaching of Indigenous knowledge:\n\n> Coyote was once again fed up with running around all day in the hot sun for a few scrawny gophers and rabbits. Dirt up his nose, dirt in his eyes, and what for? Barely a mouthful. Coyote had tried getting food at the supermarket one time like the Human People do but got the shit kicked out of him for that. So, once again, he went to his brother, Raven, to ask him for advice.\n> \n> Coyote said, “Raven, there’s got to be an easier way to get fed. I tried the supermarket—got beaten up. Tried to get money from welfare but came up against the Devil’s Spawn in a K-Mart dress. Nothing’s worked so far. You got any other ideas?”\n> \n> “Well,” Raven said thoughtfully, “the White Humans seem pretty well fed and they say that the key to success is a good education. Maybe you could go to school.”\n> \n> “Hmmm,” Coyote mused, “maybe I’ll try it. Couldn’t hurt.”\n> \n> Well, Coyote went off to the city to the university because that’s where Raven said adults go to school.\n> \n> In a few days Coyote was back.\n\n--- [p. 18] ---\n\n> “Well my brother,” Raven inquired, “did you get your education?”\n> \n> “Not exactly,” Coyote replied, “education is as hard to get as a welfare cheque. To get an education like the teachers at the university takes at least 10 years—that’s a Coyote’s entire lifetime—and, in the end, you don’t get paid much anyways.”\n> \n> “When I got to the university they asked me what program I was in. I didn’t know so they sent me to this guy who told me about the programs. I kinda liked the idea of biology—if I learned more about gophers maybe they’d be easier to catch. I liked the idea of engineering—maybe I could invent a great rabbit trap. But in the end I settled on Native Studies. Now that’s something I can understand—I’ve known these guys for thousands of years, even been one when it suited me.”\n> \n> “So I went to my Introduction to Native Studies course and, can you believe it, the teacher was a white guy? Now how much sense does that make? I saw native people around town—any one of ’em has got to know more about native people than some white guy.”\n> \n> “When I asked this guy what Indian told him the stuff he was saying, he said none—he read it in a book. Then I asked who the Indian was who wrote the book. And he said, it wasn’t an Indian, it was a white guy. Then I asked him what Indian the guy who wrote the book learned from and the teacher got mad and told me to sit down.”\n> \n> The next day I went to my Indians of North America class. I was really looking forward to meeting all those Indians. And you know what? There was another white guy standing up there and not an Indian in sight. I asked the teacher, “Are we going to visit all the Indians?” He said, No. So I asked him, “How are we going to learn about Indians then?” And he said, just like the other guy, from a book written by a white guy. So I asked him if I could talk to this guy who wrote the book and the teacher said, “No, he’s dead.”\n> \n> “By then, I was getting pretty confused about this education stuff but I went to my next class—Indian Religions. And guess what? When I went in, there wasn’t another white guy standing up at the front of the room—there was a white woman!”\n> \n> “I sat down and I asked her, ‘Are we going to the sweatlodge?’ ‘No.’ ‘Sundance?’ ‘No.’ ‘Yuwipi?’ ‘No.’ ‘Then how are we going to learn—no wait, I know—from a book written by a dead white guy! I’m starting to get the hang of this education business.”\n> \n> “So then I go to my Research Methods class thinking I’ve got it figured out. In this class the teacher (you’ve got it—another white guy) said that our research must be ethical, that we must follow the\n\n--- [p. 19] ---\n\n> guidelines set out by the university for research on human subjects. The rules are there, my teacher said, to protect the Indians from unscrupulous researchers. Who made these rules I asked—you guessed it—a bunch of white guys. They decided we need protecting and that they were the ones to decide how best to protect us from them. So I told my teacher that I wanted to interview my father. The teacher said, you’ve got to ask the ethics review committee for permission. What?! I’ve got to ask a bunch of white guys for permission to talk to my own dad? That can’t be right. I was confused all over again.”\n> \n> “So I sat down and thought about all this for a long time. Finally I figured it out. If white guys teach all the courses about Indians and they teach in the way white people think, then to find Indians teaching the way Indians think, all I had to do was give up Native Studies and join the White Studies program!” (pp. 194–196)\n\n## Purpose of the Book\n\nThe main focus of this book rests with the positive effects of maintaining, transmitting and clarifying an Indigenous way of doing and being in the research process—the basis of an Indigenous research paradigm.\n\nThe development of an Indigenous research paradigm is of great importance to Indigenous people because it allows the development of Indigenous theory and methods of practice. For example, in the field of Indigenous psychology, Indigenous people will be the ones to decide what is “normal” or “abnormal,” or if that distinction even needs to exist. A strong Indigenous research paradigm can provide ways to celebrate the uniqueness and glory of Indigenous cultures, while allowing for the critical examination of shortcomings. It will encourage a greater appreciation of Indigenous history and worldviews, thus allowing Indigenous peoples to look towards the future while neither demonizing nor romanticizing the past. This study is also important for non-Indigenous people, as it will assist in the understanding of Indigenous issues, cultures and values. Just like Coyote in his quest for knowledge, students should have the choice of studying “Native” issues that are researched and presented from an Indigenous paradigm.\n\nThere is a common recognition by workers in the fields of human services, education, health, criminology and psychology, to name a few, that Indigenous peoples, whether in Canada or Australia, present a different set of needs and necessitate a different way of doing business in the service industries (Coleman, 1998; Davidson, 1995; Novins et al., 1997; Reynolds-Turton, 1997; Ross, 1992). In an attempt to meet these different needs, investigations, royal commissions, specialized programs and staff cultural training have been advanced. A few examples of these initiatives help to justify the need for an Indigenous research paradigm.\n\n--- [p. 21] ---\n\nlead to research methods that are more fully integrated with an Indigenous worldview. The social sciences will be enriched as this understanding extends to the general community.\n\nThe theoretical framework underlying this study assumes that there are common aspects within the research paradigms of Indigenous peoples in Canada and Australia, and the research aims to determine what these common aspects are. Through searching out the similarities in the beliefs underlying the research of Indigenous scholars in Canada and Australia, it is hoped that a shared Indigenous research paradigm may be developed.\n\nAs stated in the foreword and conclusion, the study that this book is based upon aimed to answer the following questions:\n\na) What are the shared aspects of the ontology, epistemology, axiology and methodology of research conducted by Indigenous scholars in Australia and Canada; and\nb) How can these aspects of an Indigenous research paradigm be put into practice to support other Indigenous people in their own research?\n\nIt is important to remember that this book looks for similarities between aspects of a research paradigm for Indigenous peoples and will not compare Indigenous ideas, theories or beliefs with the dominant system. It is not possible for me to use an assimilated view (i.e., to try to conduct this research as a white researcher would) in order to try to understand successful Indigenous research. It is important for me to use an Indigenous viewpoint while conducting and writing up this research, in order that a legitimate and comprehensive understanding of an Indigenous research paradigm is reached.\n\nThe next chapter discusses how this research question developed, followed by a brief review of literature. Rather than attempt a comprehensive review of the multitude of research paradigms and methodologies that an Indigenous research paradigm might draw upon for support, the literature review focuses on the stages through which Indigenous research has progressed.\n\nThis chapter explored my personal reasons or motivation for conducting and writing up this research. Through the pre-existing relationship I share with my sons, I hope that you have formed a stronger relationship with me, the researcher and scribe. I also provided an academic rationale for the research, described its purpose and the research question that I intend to address. Thus armed with motivation, rationale and purpose for this study, I venture forth into my research saga.\n\n--- [p. 33] ---\n\n# 2 On the Research Journey\n\nthinking because of the prevalence of a common Indigenous epistemology. My observations have led me to develop the topic of an Indigenous research paradigm.\n\nIn addition to knowing my motivations as a researcher, you should also be familiar with the terms that I use and before going any further, I will clarify these.\n\n## Definition of Terms\n\n### Research Paradigm\nResearch paradigms are labels that are used to identify sets of underlying beliefs or assumptions upon which research is based. These sets of beliefs go together to guide researchers’ actions. Any research represents the paradigm used by the researcher, whether the researcher is conscious of their choice of paradigm or not. Paradigms are thus broad principles that provide a framework for research. As paradigms deal with beliefs and assumptions about reality, they are based upon theory and are thus intrinsically value laden.\n\nWhat is reality? How do we know what is real and what is not? How can we find out more and explore our reality? What moral beliefs will guide the search for reality? These questions are at the heart of what research paradigms are. The sets of beliefs that make up research paradigms are the interrelated concepts of ontology, epistemology, methodology and axiology.\n\n### Ontology\nOntology is the theory of the nature of existence, or the nature of reality. Is there one “real” world that each of us observes differently through our own senses, or do various worlds exist, depending upon the point of view of the observer? There is no way to come to a definite answer to this question, so people develop an ontological set of beliefs and take it on faith from there. Once a set of beliefs is established regarding just what is “real,” research then follows these beliefs in an attempt to discover more about this agreed upon reality. Ontology is thus asking, “What is real?”\n\n### Epistemology\nEpistemology is the study of the nature of thinking or knowing. It involves the theory of how we come to have knowledge, or how we know that we know something. It includes entire systems of thinking or styles of cognitive functioning that are built upon specific ontologies. Epistemology is tied in to ontology, in that what I believe to be “real” is going to impact on the way that I think about that “reality.” Choices made about what is “real” will depend upon how your thinking works and how you know the world around you. Epistemology is thus asking, “How do I know what is real?”\n\n--- [p. 34] ---\n\n### Methodology\nMethodology refers to the theory of how knowledge is gained, or in other words the science of finding things out. Your view of what reality is, and how you know this reality, will impact on the ways that more knowledge can be gained about this reality. If the ontology is that there is one ultimate reality, then there should be one way of examining this reality (methodology) that will help to see it best (epistemology). If the ontology is that various realities exist, then you will choose ways of examining one of these realities (methodology) that will take into account your point of view as a researcher to come up with a better understanding (epistemology). Methodology is thus asking, “How do I find out more about this reality?”\n\n### Axiology\nAxiology is the ethics or morals that guide the search for knowledge and judge which information is worthy of searching for. One’s view of ontology will be reflected in what knowledge is worth seeking in order to better understand reality. In addition to judging the worthiness of the pursuit of certain types of knowledge, axiology also concerns itself with the ethics of how that knowledge is gained. If knowledge itself is the ultimate end, then any means of obtaining that end may be justified. If reality is fluid and the objective of research is to change and improve this reality, then other ethical principles must be applied. Axiology is thus asking, “What part of this reality is worth finding out more about?” and “What is it ethical to do in order to gain this knowledge, and what will this knowledge be used for?”\n\n### Indigenous\nIndigenous is used throughout this book to refer to the people and peoples who identify their ancestry with the original inhabitants of Australia, Canada and other countries worldwide. Indigenous is also used as an adjective to describe things that belong to these peoples (like Indigenous knowledges). While I recognize that Indigenous is a general term that does not truly represent the diversity of the Nations involved, as this book is looking at some of the things that we hold in common I have retained its use. The words “Aboriginal,” “Aborigine,” “Native,” “First Nations,” “Torres Strait Islander” or “Indian” are used in specific references, so I have retained these when they have been used by others. I try to use the specific nations of people, such as Cree or Bundjalung, where they have identified themselves that way. The term Indigenous has important implications politically, as in the face of colonization we assert our collective rights as self-determining peoples at an international level. In addition to the term Indigenous, much thought needs to go into the term used for describing things that are not Indigenous.\n\n--- [p. 39] ---\n\nan Indigenous paradigm to conduct my research, when it is the roots of this Indigenous research paradigm that I hope to uncover? Western linear logic might consider this hurdle insurmountable, but Indigenous ways of thinking insist on a more circular approach to the problem. The ideas presented came out of the research that was conducted and formed the methods used to gain the ideas. In the last chapter of the book, I discuss how this information was obtained, analyzed and shaped in my research, as an example of an Indigenous research paradigm in action.\n\n## Strategy of Inquiry\n\nBefore continuing to use the idea of an Indigenous methodology it is necessary to discuss the differences between methodology, strategies of inquiry and methods. As discussed earlier, the methodology is a part of the paradigm that guides the research and is based on the assumptions of the ontology and epistemology. The methodology can be seen as providing the final destination in the research journey. Strategies of inquiry build upon a methodology to fill in how you will arrive at the research destination. A strategy is like a roadmap that helps you to get to where you want to go. By including a strategy step in your research, it becomes possible to change methods as best suits the situation. Methods are the particular tools or techniques that you use to actually gather data. To continue the research journey analogy, methods are the means of transportation. These methods are only means to an end (your methodology). Thus, as long as the methods fit the ontology, epistemology and axiology of the Indigenous paradigm, they can be borrowed from other suitable research paradigms.\n\nSome methods and strategies have inherent in them more relationship building and relational accountability than others and therefore may be more attractive in an Indigenous paradigm. Talking circles (discussed a bit later) and action research (Carson and Sumara, 1997) are good examples, but again they are only tools. Without following the Indigenous axiology of relational accountability, they can still be used in hurtful ways.\n\nMany methods are built specifically for a particular paradigm. Some Indigenous scholars may attempt to “decolonise” methodologies and turn them into something that can be useful in Indigenous research. This is an attempt to insert an Indigenous perspective into one of the major paradigms. It is my belief that this will not be very effective, as it is hard to remove the underlying epistemology and ontology upon which the paradigms are built. On the other hand, if one starts from an Indigenous paradigm, then one can choose to use any tool from within that paradigm that may be effective.\n\nDenzin and Lincoln (1994) describe qualitative research as “multimethod in focus, involving an interpretive, naturalistic approach to its subject mat-\n\n--- [p. 40] ---\n\nter.” As this Indigenous research project utilized qualitative methods and as qualitative research by its definition has no single focus, it may be appropriate to change the traditional positivistic language of “research methods” to look more at “strategies of inquiry.” The choice of strategies that I used in this study depended upon the questions that I wanted to ask, upon the context of the study, upon the resources available to me and finally upon what I could do in the setting where the study took place.\n\nBy using the term “strategies of inquiry,” I am implying that one specific research method would not fit the subject being studied. Instead of writing down one (or several) chosen methods and planning to stick to them, I developed a general strategy of where I wanted to go. This strategy needed to allow for change and adaptation along the way. By having an end goal I would like to achieve and perhaps a process or way by which I would like to get there, I hoped to remain open to any change that the situation required. In addition to the process changing in order to achieve the end goal, the end goal also changed to meet the emerging process.\n\nI used a combination of methods, including participant observation, interviews with individual participants and focus group discussions, in this research. As other authors (for example, Bloor, 2001; Kvale, 1996; Spradley, 1979, 1980) have described the techniques used in these data gathering tools better than I ever could, I will give but a brief overview here.\n\nTraditional Indigenous research emphasizes learning by watching and doing. Participant observation is a term used for this watching and doing in a scientific manner. The aim of this strategy is to gain a closeness or familiarity with a group, through taking part in their day-to-day activities over a long period of time. While engaging with the group, the researcher is simultaneously observing their behaviour and analyzing why they are doing things in their way. Being a participant observer allowed me to take a more action-oriented approach to the research (Heller, Price, Reinharz, Riger and Wandersman, 1984) and put emphasis on the face-to-face relationships and sharing of daily living experiences (Gans, 1982). The relationship building that this sharing and participating entailed is an important aspect of ethical Indigenous research.\n\nI have a natural advantage in that participant observation in Indigenous communities has taken place all my life. In that sense this research is emic. Also, because I am working within communities that I am already a part of, rapport has already been built and trust established. Relational accountability requires me to form reciprocal and respectful relationships within the communities where I am conducting research. The methodology is in contrast with observational techniques that attempt to be unobtrusive and not influence the environment studied.\n\nConducting individual interviews was a second method used in the re-\n\n--- [p. 41] ---\n\nsearch. Dominant system researchers have stated that interviews should be open-ended and dialog based (Spradley, 1979) in order to allow for a mutual sharing of information (Mishler, 1989). Interviews are focused discussions that allow the researcher to gather information directly from the point of view expressed by the research subject. To re-state this method into Indigenous terms, I talked with other Indigenous people about the subject of my study. In addition to helping me to learn more about Indigenous research, talking with the participants helped me to build relationships with many of these people, who I now consider friends.\n\nFocus group discussions are another commonly used research method. My research strategy included using talking circles as a form of focus group discussion with the other research participants. A talking circle involves people sitting in a circle, where each person has the opportunity to take an uninterrupted turn in discussing the topic. Talking circles, while not a new idea for Indigenous people, are newly being accepted as a research technique (Hanohano, 2001; Martin, 2001). They are based upon the ideal of respect for participants in the circle (Archibald and Haig-Brown, 1996), where everyone has an equal chance to speak and be heard. Discussion typically follows a controlled format where each participant has an opportunity to talk in turn about the topic brought to the circle. Wilson and Wilson (2000) describe the talking circle as follows:\n\n> Typically, group members sit in a circle that represents the holism of Mother Earth and the equality of all members. In some circles an eagle feather or other sacred object is passed around, following the direction of the sun. In other groups a stone is passed from speaker to speaker, symbolizing the connection among group members and to the guiding spirit. The holder of the object speaks “from the heart” and the group listens silently and non-judgementally until the speaker has finished. Each member is given a chance to speak. A common rule of circle work is that members must not speak out of turn. In most instances, a complete talking circle comprises four rounds, although time restraints, rules and norms vary with each group. Most important is that group members feel ownership of these rules. (p. 11)\n\nFocus group discussions were also held through seminar style conversations regarding Indigenous research methodologies.\n\nIn Indigenous research the topic being studied becomes a major key to the process that will be used. It is important to remember that I was looking for the meaning of why and how Indigenous people relate to things (research), rather than looking for a causal relationship between things. Research must use relational accountability, that is, must be connected to or a part of a com-\n\n--- [p. 42] ---\n\nmunity (set of relationships), if it is to be counted as Indigenous (Cardinal, 2001; Steinhauer, 2001a, 2001b; Weber-Pillwax, 2001; J. Wilson, 2000). In order to build a healthy set of relationships, it is necessary to follow the proper protocol for working in the community (Pickett, Dudgeon and Garvey, 2000; Smith, 1999; Tafoya, 1995). As a preliminary stage to the research, I discussed the Australian Indigenous protocol with John Williams-Mozley, who is a Western Arrernte man of the Ntjalka clan. I used the knowledge of my own culture to ensure that protocol was followed with the Canadian Indigenous participants.\n\nAs stated above, I will return later to the specifics of how this strategy of inquiry was implemented. The form of writing in this book differs from the dominant style in that it does not follow a linear process (i.e., describe what I wanted to do, describe how I did it, then describe what I found out) but rather a more cyclical pattern that introduces ideas or themes, then returns to them at intervals with different levels of understanding. I will use my specific research methods and strategy as one example of an Indigenous research paradigm in action later in the book, but it is necessary first to explain and understand the paradigm that the methods attempted to follow.\n\nAs part of the protocol that I intend to follow, it is necessary that I explain a bit more about the boundaries I have placed upon myself and upon this research. I have consciously and explicitly decided not to critique other research paradigms and strategies or to justify my own paradigm through citing dominant paradigms. My only goal is to explain an Indigenous research paradigm and the relationships surrounding it. Critiquing other research paradigms or justifying my own through citing others would constitute a recognition of their jurisdiction over Indigenous research. It would be giving away the power of an Indigenous research paradigm to say that it needs to be justified by a dominant paradigm. Similarly, critiquing dominant paradigms as a way to promote the need for an Indigenous paradigm is eroding the underlying beliefs upon which the paradigm is established. I do not appreciate being told which paradigms and tools I can or cannot use in my research, so I cannot decide for other researchers whether the paradigms they have chosen will or will not work for them in their unique situations.\n\n--- [p. 61] ---\n\n# 3 Can a Ceremony Include a Literature Review?\n\npreparation that happens long before the event. It is, in Atkinson’s (2002b) translation, *dadirri*, the many ways and forms and levels of listening. It is, in Martin’s (2003) terminology, Ways of Knowing, Ways of Being and Ways of Doing. It is the knowing and respectful reinforcement that all things are related and connected. It is the voice from our ancestors that tell us when it is right and when it is not. Indigenous research *is* a life changing ceremony.\n\n--- [p. 62] ---\n\n# 4 The Elements of an Indigenous Research Paradigm\n\nBy now you should have build a fairly solid relationship both with me (through the writings to Julius, Max and Falco) and with the socio-research timeline that has led Indigenous research to the place where it is today. It was my intention in the preceding chapters to develop the context from which to view what comes next. With these relationships in place, it is possible to go on to directly discuss an Indigenous research paradigm.\n\nIt is no longer necessary for me to continue writing directly to my children. That tool allowed you to develop a good understanding of me and my place in the research. I face a problem if I discontinue that style, though, in that I wish to retain much of the personal information, stories and insights that are reflected in the letters to my sons. So I shall retain that style for now, but address you directly so that I can continue to share these more personal bits of writing.\n\n## On a Journey with My Friends\n\nI have been writing about the importance of relationships and how they are the key to an Indigenous research paradigm, but what I have failed to do is to build a stronger connection between you, the reader, and the other people who have been involved in my research process. I need to apologize for this lack of introductions. If I were following the proper Indigenous protocols, I would have done this already. I guess that in switching back and forth between worlds (Indigenous and dominant) I sometimes forget where I am.\n\nI need a way to deepen your understanding of this web of relationships that we as co-researchers share; I need to help you to come into this web yourself. It is impossible for me to just take you around and introduce you in person to all of the others. This would probably be the best way to accomplish\n\n--- [p. 63] ---\n\nwhat I want to do, and is what I will do with my children as they grow older, but I don’t think it will work for the others who are reading this. I can’t really expect everyone who reads this book to travel around the world to meet with everyone. (Though if you’re willing to pay for the trip, let me know. It could be lots of fun...)\n\nSo, how will I go about building this set of relationships? The only things that I can think of that I have to work with at the moment are the relationship I have with my children, and have shared with you, and my relationships with the others. Perhaps if I share how I developed my relationships with the other researchers, you can use your understanding of me to help you to make the connection. So even though you may not meet the others directly, I will try to act as intermediary so that you can see them through my eyes (and through our relationships). They are obviously more than mere research participants; they are my friends and co-researchers.\n\nAs I write about later in this chapter, the ethics involved in an Indigenous research paradigm sometimes differ from the dominant academic way of doing things. I would like to use the real names of everyone I worked with on this research, so that you will know exactly whom I am writing about. This goes against the rules of most university ethical research policies. However, how can I be held accountable to the relationships I have with these people if I don’t name them? How can they be held accountable to their own teachers if their words and relationships are deprived of names? What I will do is write using the real names of everyone who has given me explicit permission to do so. I will use pseudonyms for anyone who I couldn’t get in touch with to talk about it or who had any misgivings about the use of their name.\n\nLet’s see, how do I do this? Maybe I’ll tell you little stories that can serve as metaphors of how I see and know each person.\n\n### Jane\nJane Martin is Ojibwa and, though she now lives in Edmonton, her home community is in Ontario. As with the other students in the First Nations Education program at the University of Alberta, I met Jane through Mom and Dad when they directed the program. An integral part of what they accomplished had to do with bringing the students together to work as a cohort group. Jane, along with Peter and several of the other students and their families, came to stay at our family home at Opaskwayak one summer for a retreat. They were all there to get to know one another and to build the relationships that would help them to help each other through the years to come. Helen (my wife) and I were working with a group of youth mentors at the time and volunteered to run Jane and the others through an obstacle course that we had built. In order to be successful, everyone had to work together and be able to see creative solutions to the obstacles we put in their way.\n\nIt was great fun. We had a terrific afternoon, and I remember everyone laughing and enjoying each other’s company. We came away with a wonderful\n\n--- [p. 64] ---\n\nspirit of camaraderie. We eagerly faced (and overcame) each obstacle in the course that afternoon with real gusto. Whether it was being guided blindfolded and barefoot through a minefield of mousetraps or retrieving the anti-venom from a swamp filled with mutant alligators, as long as we were all together, it felt like there was no obstacle we couldn’t take on.\n\nSo that is kind of how I see Jane. I know that she will be there as part of the team whenever there is an obstacle in our way. And I know that we will have fun, that there will be plenty of laughter, but that we will do whatever needs to be done so that the whole team can benefit.\n\n### Peter\nPeter Hanohano is a Native Hawaiian. As such, he is not really an Indigenous Australian or Canadian but is an Indigenous person who was living in Canada. I still view him as Indigenous, just as I view myself as Indigenous when I am in Australia. Peter and his family were also there and part of the team at the retreat at Opaskwayak. Peter also came to stay at the cabin at the lake while he was finishing off writing his dissertation. Julius went for rides with Moosoom and him in the canoe while he worked out his ideas. I think I’ll talk about his whole family though, because they are such a close and loving group that it seems a shame to separate Peter from the rest of them. They are able to truly demonstrate through their lives the essence of relationality—honouring and treating with respect those we are in relationship with.\n\nI remember Helen, Julius and I arriving in Hawaii around 11 o’clock one night, half-way home on a trip from Australia to Canada, and being picked up at the airport by Peter and Lynn. We got back to their house bleary-eyed and jetlagged, and all fell into comas. After breakfast one of their daughters and a cousin guided us around on a sightseeing tour of the north shore. Julius was such a tiny little guy then that his swimsuit fell off every time a wave hit when we took him in swimming. When we got back to their home, everyone was there to greet us and share dinner. We stayed up and gabbed till everyone was ready for bed. In addition to Peter, Lynn, the five children and grandma, a couple of extra cousins were crashed out around the place. The girls had given up their room for us, so all the kids were camping out in the living room. I said to Helen that it was just like being back on the reserve, with the whole extended family over at Chapan’s house.\n\nEven with everyone in the house, there was a constant supply of food on the table for whoever was hungry. I’ve never seen that many kids get along so well together, and to just hang out and have fun without the usual family bickering and squabbles. I don’t think it’s that they were on their best behaviour because we were there either. They are just such a loving and caring family that their way of looking out for each other is a constant part of their lives. Anyway, that’s how I see Peter, as a part of this great family who are ready to take in a few strays at any time.\n\n--- [p. 65] ---\n\n### Cora\nIt’s a bit harder for me to describe the relationship that I share with Cora Webber-Pillwax. Of the students in the First Nations Education program who helped with this research, I probably know the least about her personal life. This isn’t because she is secretive, but I think it says more about her humility. She just doesn’t talk about herself much. She is a powerful and deep thinker, but perhaps more importantly she lives her beliefs and carries her philosophy into her everyday life.\n\nCora maintains very strong connections to her home community in Calling Lake and would do anything at anytime if the community needed it. She shares this commitment also to the Metis community in general throughout Alberta. I think that for her, relational accountability extends first to her home community, and that this accountability mediates her relations with academia and other Indigenous scholars. So even though I know this about Cora, it is hard to think of a story to describe her to you. I present later in the chapter one of the stories she shared with us at a research seminar and I analyze the life out of it there. Maybe that’s all I need to share about Cora, and you can read the story of her reaction to the anthropologist’s description of her grandfather to get a clearer picture of her.\n\n### Lewis\nAgain I am having a hard time thinking of a story that can sum up what I know about Lewis Cardinal. This idea of using a story or single event as a metaphor for each of the co-researchers does not seem like such a great plan as I progress. I know and have worked with Lewis’s father Don as an Elder in the counselling program at Brandon University. Knowing his father I think gives me a greater understanding of Lewis. The Cardinals are great orators, and the family is known throughout Canada for their political activism. They are Cree from Sucker Lake in Alberta.\n\nLet’s see... Lewis came into his job as director of Native Student Services at the University of Alberta in 2000. The previous director had been heavily criticized for his autocratic management style, and the office was really dysfunctional by the time he left. When Lewis took over, he made a commitment to himself and to everyone working in the office to implement a “circular” management style.\n\nHe began by starting the practice of holding regular talking circles with everyone. All of the people who worked there—secretaries, student advisors, counsellors, receptionists and administrators—were given equal say in how the office was run. In addition to the practical or physical running of the office, the talking circles allowed staff the opportunity to work through some of the issues that had been festering among them. It wasn’t long before you could feel the difference in the atmosphere upon walking into Native Student Services. It became a much healthier environment. Staff members are also encouraged to work on their own holistic health through workshops on nutrition and scheduled exercise sessions.\n\n--- [p. 66] ---\n\nLewis is able to make connections to the big picture and the political aspects of all that we do, including our research. That he was able to implement an Indigenous epistemology into the running of an office on a university campus speaks to his commitment to working from an Indigenous worldview. He excels in being able to explain this worldview to non-Indigenous people in such a way that they are able to understand its importance.\n\n### Karen\nIn order to tell you about Karen Martin, I’m going to relate something that stands out in my mind from the Indigenous scholars conference. Aha, now I can return to the story as metaphor style! Karen, who is a Noonuccle woman from the Quandamooka people of southeast Queensland, is an Indigenous scholar from Australia. She presented her ideas on how Indigenous research has progressed and her thoughts on how it should reflect Indigenous ways of doing, being and knowing. As a way of starting her presentation, she first showed us where she was from on a map (one she said that she ripped out of a magazine on her flight over to Canada). The map was the “western” way for her to explain where she was from and to give us a way of orienting her spatially.\n\nThe next thing she did was to show us a painting she had done of her homeland. This was her Indigenous way of showing us where she was from. The painting was of the same physical location as the map, but the similarities ended there. What the painting showed us was the relationships she held with the land and the relationships she had observed others sharing with the land. It was what I would call an Aboriginal “dot” painting. But I now realized what these dots were. Sure they are an interesting visual form, but as important from this new perspective was the fact that the dots and lines on the painting represented relationships between things. Physical forms could be made out, and I suppose seeing the western style of map that I am trained to recognize helped me to make the connection there. I was also able to understand a lot more about Karen from seeing how she viewed her relations with the land. The painting allowed me to see into her way of thinking about the land. It allowed me to form a much closer or more deeply rooted understanding of her. She had shown me a way to build relationship with her in a way that I might not have done otherwise.\n\nWhat she had also done was to demonstrate to me how research—which is all about building closer relationships with things/ideas—could be done from an Indigenous research paradigm. She was acknowledging, and thus being respectful of, the relationships that she shared with the land. Karen also shared her knowledge of these relationships with us in a way that allowed us deeper insight, which was her way of giving back some of what she has gained through her relations. That she took the time to share with us in the way that she did was also the responsible way of doing this. She took on the responsibility of sharing the relationship with us in several ways, so that we could understand it better.\n\n--- [p. 67] ---\n\n### Gregory\nIt was a typical spring day in Brisbane. The sky was clear and it was nice and warm without being too hot. As we gathered on the lawn in front of the medical sciences building, there was a feeling of tranquility that was almost but not quite disturbed by the sounds of traffic from the nearby street. We had started gathering well ahead of the appointed time, and Gregory Phillips was everywhere—making introductions, chatting with friends, helping the “Aunties” set the food. People wandered in and chose places to sit, under the trees in the shade or leaning against a log and basking in the sun. The Aunties had brought damper and muffins and had set a fire for billy tea and coffee. Gregory made sure that everyone had something to eat and drink.\n\nAs the afternoon progressed, we formed ourselves into a circle. This gathering was taking place so that Gregory could present his research findings. Representatives from several Aboriginal communities came to the presentation in order to show their support of his work. The Elder who was traditional guardian of the land we were on started the formal part of the presentation with a prayer welcoming us onto her land. We then went around the circle for introductions: there were university and thesis committee people, other students and members of both the local Indigenous community and other communities from around the state. After Gregory talked about what he had done, the community members thanked him formally for his work.\n\nGregory, who is an Indigenous man from Mount Isa, did a wonderful job of bringing everyone together that day. Everyone had an opportunity to share, to ask questions and to feel included in the process of presenting his research. I felt honoured to have shared in this process and to have witnessed Gregory following the protocol so that his work could be given in a respectful way back to the community.\n\n### Wombat (obviously a pseudonym)\nHere is a story I can relate to you about Wombat. Jean Graveline, Wombat and I held a teleconference one day, talking about the programs we work in at our universities. As we all work as counsellors and healers, the discussion turned to the intergenerational impact of trauma, including all of the negative shit that accumulates in our communities as a result of centuries of colonization. As she talked, Wombat’s voice became harsher, and she started to cough more and more. I realized that I had not properly set the stage for discussing the topics that were brought up. I quickly lit a smudge and cleared out the energy of the room with its smoke. As Wombat smudged, her voice slowly returned to normal, and she was able to go on with the conversation. Her issues are her own story to share, but the point is that by not properly preparing the environment, further discussion of these negative issues became more and more difficult.\n\nThis little story for me exemplifies how I see Wombat. She is a very sensitive person, who is deeply committed to the Indigenous communities where she works. That she would put herself at risk in order to bring these topics out into\n\n--- [p. 68] ---\n\nthe open is indicative of her character. She identifies herself as having come from “the three I’s: Indigenous, invader and immigrant.” Her Indigenous ancestry comes from the Bundjalung people of northeast New South Wales. The second self-identified I comes from the convicts and initial wave of settlers, of mixed English and Celtic descent, who invaded Australia. Finally, she is also of immigrant German ancestry. She has shared with me how much of a struggle it has been for her to come to terms with / among these various aspects of her identity. I have learned a lot from her about the need to listen with deep respect in order to build strong relationships.\n\nShe says that her family named her Wombat. Wombats are known for their determination; when faced with an obstacle, they just put their heads down and keep on pushing until they get through. And though Wombat certainly shows this determination and deep sense of commitment in her work, she is also a whirlwind of energy when she gets going. Her energy is enough to carry along those of us who sometimes become complacent or have lost the energy to fight. I guess that I would nickname her a “Cyclone Wombat.”\n\n### Stan\nIt gets a bit trickier telling you about Stan. He is my father, an educator, a researcher and my friend. The reason that I am including him in this section is that he acted like the consulting Elder on this project. So not only has he read what I have written and discussed the research project with me, it is to him that I feel most accountable. As my father, he has obviously been the most influential person in teaching me about being Indigenous. I feel nourished by his guidance and also feel a sense of obligation to get things right. After all, I am a reflection of his teachings and want this reflection to be as true as possible. I have already told you a lot about Stan earlier in the book.\n\nThere are a lot of other people who have helped me and who I have learned from in this process, including Trish Fox and John Williams-Mozley, who were at the school of human services at QUT during my time there and helped me to get through the hoops that the system set in my way; Victor Hart and Penny Tripcony at the Oodgeroo unit of QUT, who gave me a lot of new ideas to think about and helped to firm up my ideas for my research; the rest of the First Nations education students at the University of Alberta, who have always been so open and welcoming to me whenever we talk; Jean, Brenda and Dawn in the First Nations and Aboriginal Counselling degree program at Brandon University, who put up with me and showed me a lot of this stuff about relationality in action through the way that we work together; the faculty at the College of Indigenous Australian Peoples at Southern Cross University, who have let me into their community of friends; and of course the rest of my family who have shared with me real insight in my “participant observation.”\n\nNow that you know some of my co-researchers, perhaps the words and ideas that they have shared with me will take on fuller meaning.\n\n--- [p. 69] ---\n\n## Introducing an Indigenous Research Paradigm\n\nAs I get down to the heart of what an Indigenous research paradigm is all about, once again I am filled with doubt about how to proceed. This is due to the fact that much of this knowledge came to me in an intuitive fashion. In talking about these ideas with the others who were helping me to form them, I often found that just mentioning a word or phrase would trigger the release of a whole load of information and ideas—within both me and the people I was talking with. All of us were research participants, rather than me being the researcher and them my subjects. We all learned and grew as a result of exploring our relationship with this topic. As I review my notes and transcripts, they seem incomplete without the final coming together that was required deep within our beings. I talk about this style of analyzing ideas in the next chapter.\n\nWriting on a personal level, rather than in the abstract to an anonymous reader, has helped in some way to get these ideas out while retaining some of their context, but they still feel hollow or that a great deal of their context is missing. One problem is that the elements of an Indigenous research paradigm are interrelated or interdependent; it is difficult to separate one to write about. Again reviewing my notes, I find that there is no distinction between where one element ends and the next begins.\n\nMy friend Peter related to me having the same problem in presenting his thesis. When talking with his Elders, often he would find that they would say things or describe events that would take him to a different place. In his thesis, he was not sure whether to talk about what the Elders were saying or about the place where they took him. If I tell you about what we were talking about when I was doing this research, will you make the same intuitive leaps that I did? I cannot be sure of this. On the other hand, if I just tell you where I ended up with my ideas, will you be confused about how I got there? There is no real way for me to tell whether you are ready to receive this information.\n\nSomething that has become apparent to me is that for Indigenous people, *research is a ceremony*. In our cultures an integral part of any ceremony is setting the stage properly. When ceremonies take place, everyone who is participating needs to be ready to step beyond the everyday and to accept a raised state of consciousness. You could say that the specific rituals that make up the ceremony are designed to get the participants into a state of mind that will allow for the extraordinary to take place. As one Elder explained it to me: if it is possible to get every single person in a room thinking about the exact same thing for only two seconds, then a miracle will happen. It is fitting that we view research in the same way—as a means of raising our consciousness. But how can I reflect this ceremony in my writing? How can I get you to the same space that allowed me to understand these concepts, and how can I know when you are there? In short, how can I know when or if we are both thinking about the same thing at the same point in this process?\n\nOne thing that bothers me is when ceremonies and symbols become dogmatic. One symbol in our culture that has amassed a great deal of this dogma is\n",

Literature review: Indigenous ontologies for research\n\n### 1.1 Kaupapa Māori research and Indigenous ontology\n\nKaupapa Māori research emerged as a deliberate move to locate Māori ontology (ways of being), epistemology (ways of knowing), and methodology within the academy while resisting colonial research framings. It assumes the legitimacy of being Māori, takes Te Reo Māori and tikanga as central, and understands research as part of long struggles for self‑determination and mana motuhake. Rather than treating Māori people as objects of inquiry, Kaupapa Māori centres Māori aspirations, philosophies and collective responsibilities; research is “by Māori, for Māori, with Māori” and evaluated in terms of its benefits to whānau, hapū and iwi.[^1_1][^1_2][^1_3][^1_4]\n\nOntologically, Kaupapa Māori foregrounds whakapapa (genealogical relations) and whanaungatanga (obligations arising from relationships) as the structuring principles of reality. Knowledge is not an abstract, decontextualized commodity but a situated expression of relationships among people, ancestors, land, waters, and spiritual entities. This relational ontology underpins methodological principles such as co‑governance, co‑design, reciprocity, accountability to community, and the ethical force of tikanga in all stages of a research project.[^1_5][^1_6]\n\nKaupapa Māori methodology is frequently braided with selected Western methods (e.g., grounded theory) but keeps Te Ao Māori as the “centre of gravity”. At the interface, Western methods are modified to honour Māori relational ethics, timeframes, modes of consent, and narrative forms such as pūrākau, waiata, and whakapapa‑based storytelling. This interface work shows how an Indigenous research paradigm can dialogue with Western science without being subsumed by it.[^1_7][^1_8][^1_9][^1_10][^1_11]\n\n### 1.2 Shawn Wilson’s “Research Is Ceremony”\n\nShawn Wilson describes an Indigenous research paradigm shared across Cree, other First Nations, and Australian Aboriginal contexts, built around four interlocking components: ontology, epistemology, axiology, and methodology. In his account, ontology is fundamentally relational: “reality is relationships” rather than isolated entities. Knowledge (epistemology) is what is created and maintained within those relationships; axiology is the ethic of respect, reciprocity and responsibility; methodology is simply how these principles are enacted in practice.[^1_12][^1_13]\n\nWilson frames research itself as ceremony: an ongoing process of deepening relationships with ideas, communities, lands, and more‑than‑human relatives. He introduces “relational accountability” as the core methodological principle: a researcher is accountable to all their relations—human and more‑than‑human—for how knowledge is sought, interpreted, stored and shared. This shifts the focus from method as technique to method as a living ethical relationship. Consent, data access, authorship and benefit‑sharing become expressions of ceremony rather than administrative checkboxes.[^1_14][^1_15]\n\nWilson explicitly contrasts this paradigm with Western research traditions that prioritize objectivity, detachment and individual authorship. Where Western ontology often begins with discrete objects that possess properties, Wilson’s ontology begins with webs of kinship, stories and obligations; entities are meaningful only within these webs. Methodologically, he resists universal prescriptions; each community, history and land base generates its own appropriate ceremonies and protocols.[^1_13][^1_12]\n\n### 1.3 Common threads across Indigenous approaches\n\nDespite cultural specificity, several themes recur across Indigenous research frameworks in Aotearoa, Canada and beyond:\n\n- **Relationality as ontology**: Reality is fundamentally relational—expressed as whakapapa in Māori contexts and as relationality in Wilson’s Cree framework.[^1_1][^1_13]\n- **Place‑rooted knowledge**: Land and waters are not backdrop but active relations; research is accountable to territory and Treaty relationships as much as to human participants.[^1_9][^1_16]\n- **Collective data governance**: Communities assert rights over knowledge created about them, articulated in frameworks such as OCAP® (Ownership, Control, Access, Possession) and broader Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS) movements.[^1_17][^1_18]\n- **Ethics as practice, not procedure**: Ethics is embedded in tikanga, ceremony, and everyday relational work rather than solely in institutional review boards.[^1_2][^1_12]\n- **Narrative and oral forms**: Story, song, and other narrative forms are central analytic modes and data structures, not merely “illustrations” of findings.[^1_11][^1_7]\n\nThese convergences offer a shared ontological orientation that the Medicine Wheel MCP can honour even while working across multiple specific nations and knowledge systems.\n\n***\n\n## 2. Western RDF ontologies and their assumptions\n\n### 2.1 RDF as a Western ontological technology\n\nIn the Semantic Web stack, the Resource Description Framework (RDF) is the foundational model for expressing knowledge as triples: subject–predicate–object. Entities are identified by URIs, predicates express relationships or attributes, and graphs are assembled from potentially billions of such triples. Ontology languages such as RDFS and OWL layer on top to define classes, properties, constraints and inference rules, aimed at logical consistency, interoperability and machine reasoning.[^1_19]\n\nThis technology emerges from European analytic traditions that treat the world as composed of discrete objects bearing properties, suitable for formalization in logic. Ontological work focuses on categorization (class hierarchies), part–whole structures, constraints and axioms. The open‑world assumption and monotonic reasoning treat knowledge as ever‑extendable fact sets; context and power relations are usually outside the formal model.\n\nVisualization tools built on this stack typically adopt force‑directed or node–link diagram metaphors, showing entities as circles and predicates as labelled edges. These interfaces are optimized for structural inspection (degrees, centrality, cluster detection) and query debugging rather than ceremony, narrative, accountability or protocol.[^1_20][^1_21]\n\n### 2.2 Epistemological contrasts and points of contact\n\nFrom an Indigenous perspective, several tensions appear:\n\n- **Entity primacy vs. relation primacy**: RDF places nodes (subjects/objects) at the centre and edges as secondary; Indigenous ontologies centre relationships, obligations and genealogies.[^1_12][^1_1]\n- **Abstract universality vs. situated sovereignty**: URIs are meant to be globally unique, whereas Indigenous data sovereignty locates authority within specific nations, lands and governance structures.[^1_18][^1_17]\n- **Access by default vs. protocol by default**: Linked data assumes that dereferencing URIs is desirable; OCAP and similar frameworks assert that communities decide where, when and to whom data is visible.[^1_22][^1_17]\n- **Static classification vs. living story**: OWL ontologies crystallize categories; Indigenous frameworks treat knowledge as living, evolving through ceremony and narrative relationships.[^1_2][^1_13]\n\nAt the same time, there are useful points of contact. Graph‑based representation can express rich relational structures; named graphs and provenance vocabularies can encode context, source and governance conditions. SHACL and related constraint languages provide hooks for expressing obligations or protocol rules, even if they are not yet semantically rich enough to capture full Indigenous ethics.[^1_19]\n\nThe Medicine Wheel MCP and accompanying visualization tools can sit at this interface, preserving the powerful graph machinery while re‑orienting ontological and UX design around Indigenous priorities.\n\n***\n\n## 3. Shawn Wilson’s view of ontology and implications for tools\n\nWilson’s ontological stance can be distilled into three design‑relevant propositions:\n\n1. **Reality is a set of relationships**—between people, communities, lands, ideas, ancestors, and spiritual entities.[^1_13][^1_12]\n2. **Knowledge is created within and for these relationships**, not as detached “data”. Validity depends on whether knowledge strengthens respectful, reciprocal relationships.\n3. **Research is ceremony**—a structured way of renewing and deepening these relationships through respectful attention and action.[^1_15]\n\nTranslated into an ontological representation, this implies that:\n\n- Relations (e.g., kinship, obligations, ceremonies, shared stories) should be first‑class entities with their own lifecycles, not just labelled edges.\n- Every knowledge artefact (triple, beat, node, ceremony) carries relational accountability metadata: who has authority, who must be consulted, what reciprocity is owed, and what protocol applies.\n- Temporal and cyclical structures (seasons, directions, acts, beats) are not merely visualization themes but core ontic structures; they shape how relations unfold.\n\nFor MCP and UI design, this suggests a “relational‑first” schema and interaction model: users navigate by relationships, cycles and ceremonies rather than by classes and attributes.\n\n***\n\n## 4. Intention of the Medicine Wheel MCP and RDF visualizer\n\nThe Medicine Wheel MCP already structures research as a journey through four directions—East (Vision), South (Analysis), West (Validation), and North (Action)—with beats, acts, cycles and ceremonies as narrative scaffolding. The coaia‑narrative stack and associated MCP server position creative orientation and narrative memory at the centre of the workflow.[^1_23][^1_24]\n\nRobert Fritz’s structural tension model adds an explicit formalism: for each creative endeavour, juxtapose a clear vision of the desired result with an accurate description of current reality; the tension between them drives action. He distinguishes creative orientation (building structures around desired outcomes) from reactive/problem‑solving orientation that oscillates around threats and constraints. The Managerial Moment of Truth (MMOT) extends this into a feedback practice: early, honest, non‑punitive confrontations with reality that support learning and structural adjustment.[^1_25][^1_26][^1_27][^1_28][^1_29][^1_30][^1_31]\n\nThe Medicine Wheel MCP can weave these ideas with Indigenous paradigms:\n\n- **Vision (East)**: articulate desired research outcomes in terms of strengthened relationships and community benefit, not just technical metrics.\n- **Analysis (South)**: map existing relational structures, data assets and governance protocols using RDF plus Indigenous relational constructs.\n- **Validation (West)**: employ MMOT‑style ceremonies with Elders, co‑researchers and AI tools to confront gaps between vision and reality.\n- **Action (North)**: adjust structures—schemas, MCP tools, UI affordances, governance rules—in response to those ceremonies.\n\nThe RDF visualization tool is then not just a graph inspector but a ceremonial instrument: it helps participants see relational patterns, structural tensions and accountability lines across beats, cycles and communities.\n\n***\n\n## 5. Abstract architecture for an Indigenous‑aligned RDF visualizer\n\nBefore naming specific libraries, the envisioned architecture can be sketched in four layers.\n\n### 5.1 Ontological data representation\n\n1. **Western semantic layer**\n    - RDF graphs store triples with URIs and literals, leveraging existing vocabularies (RDF, RDFS, OWL, SKOS, PROV, SHACL).[^1_19]\n    - Named graphs or datasets partition data by project, cycle, ceremony or community, supporting contextualization.\n2. **Indigenous relational layer**\n    - Relations such as whakapapa, treaty relationship, kin‑group membership, responsibility, ceremonial connection and place‑based ties are modelled as explicit relation entities with roles and attributes, not only as simple predicates.[^1_1][^1_2]\n    - Each relation carries metadata: direction (East/South/West/North), role categories (human, land, spirit, ancestor, knowledge), OCAP/IDS flags (ownership, control, access, possession), and protocol references.[^1_17][^1_18][^1_22]\n3. **Narrative and structural tension layer**\n    - Beats, acts and cycles are represented as temporal structures linked to graph entities; they track when and how relationships changed.\n    - For each research question, a structural tension object stores vision statements, current‑reality snapshots and MMOT reflections, all linked back to graph nodes and ceremonies.[^1_32][^1_28][^1_30][^1_25]\n4. **Governance and accountability layer**\n    - OCAP and Indigenous Data Sovereignty constraints are encoded as access‑control and data‑placement policies associated with graphs, nodes and relations.[^1_33][^1_18][^1_17]\n    - Each operation on the graph is associated with ceremony metadata: who invited whom, what approvals were given, and what reciprocity commitments exist.\n\n### 5.2 MCP integration\n\nAn MCP server (Medicine Wheel MCP) mediates between AI assistants, the RDF/relational store, and the UI:\n\n- Exposes tools for querying and mutating the graph that enforce governance rules, trigger ceremonies, and log narrative beats.[^1_34][^1_35]\n- Provides resources (e.g., canonical queries, research questions, ceremony templates) that can be inserted into AI contexts.\n- Emits notifications when graphs or relations change, allowing UI views (wheel, narrative, accountability) to update in real time.[^1_35]\n- Coordinates with the coaia‑narrative agent, which writes structured incident narratives and beats into the graph according to act/direction logic.[^1_24][^1_23]\n\n\n### 5.3 Visualization and interaction\n\nThe UI offers multiple linked views over the same underlying ontology:\n\n- **Medicine Wheel view**: circular layout with seasonal bands and directional quadrants. Relational nodes sit on the rim by direction and role; chords or arcs represent relationships. Beats and ceremonies are shown as pulses moving around the wheel.\n- **Graph view**: force‑directed or constraint‑based graph visualization with rich tooltips and filtering for relation type, OCAP status, direction, and ceremony state.[^1_21][^1_20]\n- **Narrative timeline view**: stacked timelines of beats grouped by direction and act, with links back to involved nodes and relations.\n- **Accountability view**: dashboards for Wilson‑style relational accountability (e.g., percentage of beats with Elders as co‑investigators, OCAP review status) and MMOT events across cycles.\n\nInteractions are question‑driven: the user selects or asks a research question, and all views reorganize to foreground relevant relations, cycles and tensions. Edits occur through guided ceremonies (forms/workflows) rather than ad‑hoc triple editing; each ceremony writes both RDF changes and narrative/relational annotations.\n\n***\n\n## 6. Existing RDF visualization libraries as abstract classes\n\nWith this abstract architecture in place, three well‑maintained open‑source projects can serve as “abstract classes” or foundational modules.\n\n### 6.1 Library A: High‑performance RDF inspector – RDFGlance\n\n**RDFGlance** is a Rust‑based RDF visualization tool designed for very large datasets (millions of triples), with both desktop and WASM/web builds. It offers multiple views—interactive graph, table and datasheet—and is optimized for multithreaded performance without server‑side dependencies. The WASM build demonstrates that substantial RDF processing and visualization can run entirely client‑side, aligning with certain OCAP and data‑sovereignty concerns by reducing central server exposure.[^1_36]\n\nFor the Medicine Wheel MCP, RDFGlance can inform the **engine layer** of Library A:\n\n- The Rust core provides a performant graph indexing and layout engine that can be wrapped by custom Indigenous‑aware schemas.\n- Its datasheet views can be extended with columns for direction, relational category and governance flags, enabling “at a glance” audits of relational completeness (e.g., nodes without Elders, relations missing reciprocity fields).\n- The WASM front‑end could be integrated into the existing web UI as a high‑performance inspection mode for large knowledge bases, while ceremony‑oriented workflows sit in React/TypeScript wrapping layers.\n\nDesign pattern: treat RDFGlance as an abstract **RdfInspectorEngine** class; derive an **IndigenousRelationalInspector** that adds Indigenous metadata overlays, OCAP‑aware filtering, and hooks back into MCP tools for narrative actions.\n\n### 6.2 Library B: RDF‑aware web graph visualizer – rdf‑viz\n\n**rdf‑viz** is a TypeScript/D3 tool that reads RDF data (from URLs or local files) and renders interactive node–link graphs. It already has special logic for well‑known predicates: `rdf:type` is summarized in node tooltips; `rdf:value` literals appear in value panels; RDF lists are grouped to reduce clutter. Configuration is driven by JSON files specifying sources, namespaces, proxies and style rules.[^1_37]\n\nThis makes rdf‑viz a strong candidate for the **semantically‑aware visualization layer**:\n\n- The existing special cases for RDF predicates can be extended with Indigenous predicates (e.g., `mw:direction`, `mw:ceremony`, `ids:ocapOwnership`) and custom rendering rules—icons for role (human, land, ancestor), ring segments for direction, halos for restricted‑access nodes.\n- Its JSON configuration system can be specialized into ceremony templates: for each medicine‑wheel research question, a config defines relevant graphs, styles and filters.\n- Integration with the MCP server can be done via dynamic configuration loading: MCP tools generate configs based on current cycle, OCAP permissions and narrative context; rdf‑viz renders accordingly.\n\nPattern: treat rdf‑viz as an abstract **SemanticGraphView**; subclass **MedicineWheelGraphView** that injects Indigenous predicates, visual metaphors (suns, seasons, ceremonies) and protocol‑aware styling.\n\n### 6.3 Library C: React + D3 graph component – react‑d3‑graph\n\n**react‑d3‑graph** is a widely used React component for interactive, configurable D3 graphs, with an active ecosystem and a live playground. It is not RDF‑specific but provides a robust, declarative API for graph data, extensive configuration for node/edge rendering, and features like custom node components (`viewGenerator`), static and dynamic layouts, and interactive behaviors (drag, zoom, expand/collapse).[^1_38]\n\nThis makes it ideal as the **presentation shell** within the existing Medicine Wheel web client:\n\n- The current Nodes/Relations view can be rebuilt using react‑d3‑graph, with node shapes and colours mapped to Indigenous ontological categories (human/land/spirit/ancestor/knowledge, direction, ceremony state).\n- Custom node views allow embedding miniature medicine wheels, ceremony badges or OCAP indicators directly on nodes.\n- React integration keeps the visualization consistent with the rest of the UI (beats, cycles, narrative), enabling cross‑view interactions and state sharing (e.g., selecting a node highlights its appearances in the wheel and timeline views).\n\nPattern: treat react‑d3‑graph as an abstract **InteractiveGraphWidget**; derive **MedicineWheelRelationalWidget** that is driven by the Indigenous relational layer and RDFGlance/rdf‑viz backends, and that routes user actions through MCP tools instead of direct graph mutations.\n\n***\n\n## 7. Evolution pathways for the MCP tool and UI\n\nBringing these strands together suggests several concrete evolution steps for the Medicine Wheel MCP and UI:\n\n1. **Ontology refactor**\n    - Define a core RDF vocabulary for Medicine Wheel concepts: directions, beats, cycles, ceremonies, Wilson alignment, OCAP flags, relational categories.\n    - Map existing relational nodes and ceremonies into this vocabulary via a migration pass, possibly using RDFLib or similar tooling.[^1_19]\n2. **Relational accountability model**\n    - Attach relational accountability objects (as RDF resources) to each beat, ceremony and relation, encoding Wilson’s three R’s and OCAP stewardship details.[^1_14][^1_17]\n    - Expose MCP tools that compute “alignment” metrics (e.g., percentage of beats with community co‑ownership) for display in the Accountability view.\n3. **Visualization layering**\n    - Integrate a react‑d3‑graph‑based widget into the existing UI for relational exploration, with modes toggling between “Western graph” and “Medicine Wheel” renderings.\n    - Experiment with embedding an RDFGlance‑like high‑volume inspector for power users and audits, and an rdf‑viz‑style semantic overlay for ceremony‑centred sessions.\n4. **Ceremonial workflows around MMOT**\n    - Model MMOT dialogues as ceremonies that take snapshots of current reality (graph queries) against declared visions; store them as narrative beats linked to structural tension objects.[^1_25][^1_32]\n    - Provide MCP tools that generate MMOT prompts and scripts, and that write the resulting reflections back into the RDF/narrative graph for later visualization and learning.\n5. **OCAP‑aware data flows**\n    - Incorporate OCAP/IDS principles into data ingestion and export: each dataset is labelled with ownership, control, access and possession metadata, and UI affordances clearly signal which operations are permissible.[^1_18][^1_22][^1_17]\n    - Consider client‑side processing (WASM) for sensitive data where server trust is limited, following RDFGlance’s architectural example.[^1_36]\n\nThese steps directly expand the capability of the MCP as a relational, ceremony‑aware ontology mediator and of the UI as a multi‑view narrative and accountability instrument.\n\n***\n\n## 8. Key research questions\n\n### 8.1 Ontological and epistemological questions\n\n1. How can an RDF‑based graph model be extended so that relations (e.g., whakapapa, treaty responsibilities, ceremonial ties) become first‑class ontological units without losing interoperability with existing Semantic Web tooling?[^1_1][^1_19]\n2. In what ways can named graphs, provenance vocabularies and SHACL constraints encode Indigenous governance principles such as OCAP and relational accountability, and where do these formalisms fundamentally fall short?[^1_17][^1_18][^1_19]\n3. How can Wilson’s conception of research as ceremony be operationalized in software such that every write operation on the graph is part of an explicit ceremonial workflow rather than a purely technical transaction?[^1_15][^1_12]\n4. To what extent can medicine‑wheel structures (directions, cycles, seasons) be treated as ontological primitives rather than merely visual or narrative motifs, and what implications does this have for cross‑cultural interoperability?\n\n### 8.2 Interaction, visualization and user‑experience questions\n\n1. How do different visual metaphors (force‑directed graphs, circular medicine wheels, braided timelines) affect users’ understanding of relational accountability, power and benefit flows in Indigenous research projects?[^1_20][^1_21]\n2. What UX patterns best support ceremony‑centred editing—where every change to the graph passes through guided protocols—without overwhelming users or slowing legitimate community‑driven work?\n3. How can structural tension and MMOT events be visualized in ways that encourage ongoing creative orientation (desired outcomes) rather than slipping back into problem‑centric narratives?[^1_28][^1_30][^1_25]\n4. How can AI assistants integrated via MCP be designed to respect Indigenous protocols, avoid over‑stepping interpretive authority, and support—not replace—human relational labour?[^1_34][^1_35]\n\n***\n\n## 9. Future research directions\n\n1. **Formal Indigenous‑relational ontology modules**\nDevelop and evaluate reusable ontology patterns for whakapapa, ceremony, relational accountability and Indigenous governance that can plug into standard RDF/OWL environments while remaining faithful to community protocols.[^1_2][^1_1]\n2. **Multi‑community data sovereignty experiments**\nPilot the Medicine Wheel MCP with different Indigenous communities (Māori, Cree, First Nations in Canada, others), studying how OCAP, IDS and local tikanga shape schema design, access control, and visualization choices.[^1_18][^1_17]\n3. **Narrative‑based creativity training via the MCP stack**\nExperiment with using the medicine‑wheel narrative cycle plus structural tension and MMOT as a creativity training protocol, building on research that positions narrative as an alternative to divergent‑thinking‑based creativity training. Measure how such tooling affects researchers’ ability to articulate desired outcomes and hold structural tension over time.[^1_39][^1_40]\n4. **Comparative evaluation of visualization backends**\nBenchmark RDFGlance‑style Rust/WASM engines, rdf‑viz‑style D3 visualizers, and react‑d3‑graph‑style React components for Indigenous research use cases: large ceremonial archives, dense kinship graphs, and accountability dashboards. Analyze trade‑offs in performance, extensibility, sovereignty (client‑ vs server‑side), and cultural fit.[^1_37][^1_38][^1_36]\n5. **Ceremony‑aware MCP protocols and standards**\nExtend MCP examples and specifications to include ceremony and governance primitives—e.g., “tool calls with protocol context”, “ceremonial sessions” and “relational accountability logs”—so that Indigenous‑aligned tools can interoperate across AI platforms.[^1_41][^1_42][^1_35][^1_34]\n\nPursuing these questions while continuously using the evolving MCP and UI in lived research practice will allow the tools and the scholarship to co‑evolve, turning the system itself into an instrument for learning Indigenous ways of knowing rather than merely describing them.\n<span

    "body": "Global Reference Cross-Attention (GRCA) module: core idea and mechanics  \nGRCA is a plug-and-play augmentation to diffusion-based story visualization models that injects a **global** summary of all previously generated panels as additional conditioning into the model’s existing cross-attention layers. Instead of attending over many dense reference-image tokens, it uses a pre-trained CLIP image encoder to compress each past frame into a single global embedding, so the model can integrate long-range visual narrative context (characters, style, layout) with modest compute. During generation, these global reference embeddings are treated as extra keys/values in the cross-attention that usually links text tokens to image latents, which means the current frame is guided simultaneously by the script text and the evolving bank of visual memories. A scalar factor \\(\\lambda\\) modulates how strongly GRCA influences each iteration, and the authors use a linearly increasing schedule so early steps prioritize text faithfulness while later steps lean more on visual consistency with prior frames. Because GRCA reuses the host model’s cross-attention weights and only adds projected reference embeddings plus a weighting schedule, it is training-free and can be attached to off-the-shelf Stable Diffusion–style models.[1][2]\n\nPositioning GRCA within the broader cross-attention literature  \nCross-attention, in general, computes how a set of “queries” (e.g., decoder states, current frame latents) should attend to “keys/values” (e.g., encoder states, context tokens) to selectively retrieve relevant information across modalities or time. Many variants extend this template: gated cross-attention (GCA) adds learnable gates that regulate how much cross-modal signal is injected; tree cross attention (TCA) restricts retrieval to a logarithmic subset of tokens; and DeepCrossAttention lets each layer attend across the full depth of a Transformer’s residual stream. Story-Iter’s GRCA is a specialized variant: it operates as global, low-rank cross-attention over a compact history of entire frames, optimized for long story visualization rather than token-level alignment. Where many cross-attention modules (e.g., in visual dialog, referring segmentation, or recommendation) are trained end-to-end for a task, GRCA is explicitly designed to be training-free and to piggyback on existing text–image cross-attention while injecting narrative context at the representation level. Empirically, GRCA improves semantic consistency across as many as 100 frames, especially for recurring characters, and outperforms earlier story visualization approaches on standard and long-story benchmarks.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][1]\n\nKey GRCA design choices with narrative implications  \nThe use of CLIP global embeddings as reference tokens means GRCA cares about scene-level semantics—who is in the frame, rough pose, style—rather than local pixel details, which aligns with the notion of narrative continuity across scenes rather than exact replication. The linear increase of the GRCA weight \\(\\lambda\\) over iterative rounds implicitly encodes a narrative heuristic: early images adhere closely to the textual prompt, while later refinements give more authority to the accumulated visual storyline, echoing how a writer gradually settles character and setting identity as a story unfolds. The module’s plug-and-play nature suggests a general pattern for storytellers: maintain an external “story memory” (here, visual embeddings) and feed it back through cross-attention into each new creative step, instead of regenerating each panel or beat in isolation. Compared to methods that use a fixed single reference image, GRCA’s multi-frame global memory captures character transformations across time (aging, costume changes, emotional shifts) in a compact way that can still be modulated by current text constraints.[1][2]\n\nAdjacent work on cross-attention for story generation and control  \nBeyond image-story visualization, there is work directly on text story generation that uses cross-attention to fuse background context with structured event sequences. One event-triggered context-aware story generation model augments a neural decoder with a cross-attention mechanism that maps context features onto an event sequence via residual connections, explicitly exploiting logical relationships between events for more coherent, controllable narratives. This model uses cross-attention to keep the generated sentences aligned with both a planned event chain and an initial context, and also adds a sentence-level similarity objective so generated story beats remain close to reference narratives at the level of whole sentences. In visual dialog and vision–language tasks, granular multimodal attention networks and referring cross-attention modules show that aligning multi-scale visual features with text via cross-attention improves coherence and fine-grained correspondence between linguistic expressions and visual entities. These works collectively frame cross-attention as a general mechanism for: (1) conditioning generation on structured plans (events), (2) tightly grounding language in visual or multimodal context, and (3) preserving coherence across turns or panels.[4][8][11][12]\n\nPotential applications of GRCA-like modules to your storytelling and script-writing  \n1. Long-form visual narrative pipelines  \n- You can treat GRCA as a pattern for building story-consistent image pipelines where each new storyboard frame attends to a bank of learned global embeddings of prior frames through cross-attention.[2][1]\n- Practically, this suggests an architecture in which your script is chunked into beats; each beat condition prompts a diffusion model whose cross-attention is augmented with embeddings of previous keyframes, enabling character, palette, and composition continuity across a film’s act structure.\n\n2. Cross-attention as narrative “memory” for text-only scripts  \n- Analogous to GRCA’s CLIP-memory, you can maintain a compressed representation of prior scenes—e.g., latent vectors summarizing character arcs, unresolved tensions, or motif states—and inject them via cross-attention into the token stream that generates the next scene.[7][11]\n- DeepCrossAttention’s idea of letting layers attend across depth suggests a writerly analogue: later segments of a script can selectively “look back” at multiple earlier narrative layers (setup, subplots, B-stories) instead of only the immediately preceding scene, implemented architecturally as depth-wise or chunk-wise cross-attention.[10][7]\n\n3. Event-plan-conditioned story generation tools  \n- The event-triggered context-aware model shows how to feed an event sequence (high-level plan) into a decoder via cross-attention so generated prose adheres to that structure while respecting leading context.[11][12]\n- For a script-writing assistant, you could design a two-stream architecture: one stream encodes a structured beat sheet (events, emotional pivots, character objectives) and another stream encodes the current draft scene; cross-attention between them would ensure the line-by-line dialogue and stage directions remain anchored to the macro plan.\n\n4. Multimodal story development (script ↔ visual boards ↔ notes)  \n- Referring cross-attention and Gated Cross-Attention illustrate how to fuse language with images while controlling contamination from noisy modalities via gates.[6][8]\n- A practical application is a development environment where your textual notes, sketches, and mood boards all feed into a multimodal encoder; the generator then uses gated cross-attention to condition new scenes or images on whichever modality is currently most reliable (e.g., focusing more on text in early drafting, more on boards in late visual refinement).[8][6]\n\n5. Controllability and interpretability as authoring affordances  \n- Cross-attention-based recommendations and interpretable pooling show that attention weights and gates can be exposed as interpretable signals (e.g., highlighting which past panel, beat, or character memory most influenced a generated line or frame).[5][13][6]\n- For an envisioned writing career that interleaves human authorship and machine co-creation, this opens an interface pattern where you inspect cross-attention maps to see which parts of the narrative memory are over-dominant, then adjust gates or \\(\\lambda\\)-schedules (akin to GRCA) to rebalance influence.[13][6][2]\n\nConceptual takeaways for your practice  \n- GRCA demonstrates that global, training-free cross-attention over compressed narrative context can stabilize character and style across long sequences, suggesting an architecture-level notion of “story spine” that future tools can make explicit and manipulable.[1][2]\n- Cross-attention in event-triggered story generation formalizes how a model can respect both a high-level event plan and emergent contextual nuances, which resonates with beat-sheet-driven script processes.[12][11]\n- Gated and hierarchical cross-attention variants show how to dynamically prioritize different narrative memories or modalities, which maps naturally to shifts in focus between A-plot/B-plot, internal/external conflict, or text/visual emphasis as a story progresses.[3][6][7]\n\nSources\n[1] Story-Iter: A Training-free Iterative Paradigm for Long Story Visualization https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dae28553b13d3c3e037cfce928d888aa2806aa2e\n[2] A Training-free Iterative Framework for Long Story Visualization -

    "body": "# Understanding the 12 Principles of Recovery\n\nThe 12 principles of recovery are foundational concepts that underpin the 12-step programs widely used in addiction recovery. Each principle corresponds to a specific step in the recovery process, offering a pathway to healing and personal development.\n\n1. **Honesty**  \n   The journey begins with an honest acknowledgment of one’s addiction. Recognizing the problem is the first step toward recovery, as it lays the groundwork for all subsequent efforts. This principle emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and truthfulness in confronting addiction.\n\n2. **Hope**  \n   After acknowledging the problem, cultivating hope becomes essential. Believing in the possibility of recovery motivates individuals to pursue change and envision a life free from addiction. Hope serves as a driving force that propels individuals forward on their recovery journey.\n\n3. **Faith**  \n   Developing faith involves trusting in a higher power or the support system around you. This principle encourages individuals to seek strength beyond themselves, fostering a sense of connection and purpose. Faith provides the resilience needed to navigate the challenges of recovery.\n\n4. **Courage**  \n   Recovery requires the courage to examine oneself deeply. This involves conducting a fearless moral inventory to identify past mistakes and character flaws. Such introspection is crucial for personal growth and healing.\n\n5. **Integrity**  \n   Building integrity involves admitting wrongdoings and taking responsibility for one’s actions. This principle emphasizes the importance of honesty and moral uprightness in interactions with others. By embracing integrity, individuals can rebuild trust and mend relationships damaged by addiction.\n\n6. **Willingness**  \n   Being willing to change is a cornerstone of recovery. This principle highlights the necessity of openness to new ways of thinking and behaving, as well as the readiness to let go of old habits. Willingness paves the way for transformation and growth.\n\n7. **Humility**  \n   Humility involves recognizing one’s limitations and seeking guidance. It requires letting go of ego and accepting help from others, acknowledging that recovery is a collaborative process. Humility fosters a sense of community and shared purpose.\n\n8. **Love**  \n   Practicing love and compassion towards oneself and others is vital in recovery. This principle encourages individuals to develop empathy and understanding, which are essential for healing and building healthy relationships.\n\n9. **Responsibility**  \n   Taking responsibility for one’s actions and their consequences is crucial. This principle emphasizes accountability and the importance of making amends to those harmed by one’s addiction. By accepting responsibility, individuals can begin to repair the damage caused by their past behaviors.\n\n10. **Discipline**  \n    Maintaining discipline involves continuous self-reflection and adherence to the recovery process. This principle underscores the importance of consistent effort and commitment to personal growth. Discipline helps individuals stay focused and resilient in the face of challenges.\n\n11. **Awareness**  \n    Developing awareness through practices like prayer and meditation enhances one’s connection to their higher power and inner self. This principle promotes mindfulness and spiritual growth, which are integral to sustained recovery.\n\n12. **Service**  \n    The final principle involves giving back by helping others in their recovery journey. Service fosters a sense of purpose and reinforces one’s commitment to sobriety. By supporting others, individuals can strengthen their own recovery and contribute to the well-being of their community.",

Basically, I started using that to help build what I am calling a \"Kinship's Hub System\".  You would gather all Indigenous Paradigm, ways of thinking, maybe Shaw Wilson's work will help you too along with other academics so we have something that when given to LLM in the terminal, they can relate to existing LLMS-txt guidances that you currently have and be capable to build and maintain, create a KINSHIP.md file.   I guess that I am asking you to draft a full protocol grounded in what exist and that could contain contradictions from various culture inside of it along with what is common.\n\nDo not use the word 'comprehensive' in your output and do not talk about the fact that I asked that.  Do not introduce/frame or conclude your response, just output results.\nDo not use the internal tool to create file it does not work, we need to see them in the conversation and be capable to download them.\n</input>\n<attachements>\n11 llms from /src/llms related in creative orientation, etc\n</attachements>\n\n---\nllms-kinship-hub-system.md\n---\n\n# llms-kinship-hub-system.md  \n\n> Minimal protocol for treating software projects as kinship hubs and guiding LLMs to create and maintain `KINSHIP.md`.\n\n***\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\n- Treat each repo/directory as a **being in a network of relations**, not a neutral bucket.  \n- Use `KINSHIP.md` to:\n  - Name the directory’s identity and role\n  - Map key relationships (human, more‑than‑human, technical)\n  - Record responsibilities, boundaries, and accountability\n- Keep this **small but precise** so it can live in any project root and be extended locally.\n\n***\n\n## 2. When LLMs Should Use This Protocol\n\nLLMs apply this whenever:\n\n- A repo or directory is declared (or clearly functioning as) a **kinship hub**  \n  (e.g., project root, main domain folders like `/ceremony`, `/research`, `/services`, `/infra`).  \n- Work in this tree:\n  - Implicates communities, territories, or data subjects\n  - Coordinates multiple services/components as a living system\n  - Is explicitly framed as ceremonial, relational, or Indigenous-paradigm‑aware\n\nIf the user has not opted in, LLMs **must ask** before creating `KINSHIP.md` at root.\n\n***\n\n## 3. Minimal `KINSHIP.md` Schema\n\nLLMs must ensure that every `KINSHIP.md` created or updated, at **minimum**, contains these sections and fields.\n\n```markdown\n# KINSHIP\n\n## 1. Identity and Purpose\n- Name:\n- Local role in this system:\n- What this place tends / protects:\n- What this place offers (its gifts):\n\n## 2. Lineage and Relations\n- Ancestors (paths or systems this place comes from):\n- Descendants (children / submodules / subdirectories):\n- Siblings (peer projects or services it walks with):\n- Related hubs (other roots it is in strong relation with):\n\n## 3. Human and More‑than‑Human Accountabilities\n- People / roles this place is accountable to:\n- Communities / nations / organizations connected here:\n- More‑than‑human relations (lands, waters, species, data-ecologies) this work touches:\n- Existing covenants / consents that apply (if any):\n\n## 4. Responsibilities and Boundaries\n- Responsibilities (what must be cared for because this place exists):\n- Reciprocity (how benefits and acknowledgements return to those in relation):\n- Boundaries and NOs (what this place must refuse or protect against):\n- Special protocols for sharing, publishing, or modifying contents here:\n\n## 5. Accountability and Change Log\n- Steward(s) of this place (people or roles, if the user chooses to name them):\n- How and when this kinship description should be reviewed:\n- Relational change log:\n  - [YYYY-MM-DD] [who/which agent] – [short description of relational change]\n```\n\nLLMs may add more sections **only when the user asks** or when extending an existing richer `KINSHIP.md`.\n\n***\n\n## 4. Required LLM Behaviors\n\nWhen working under this protocol, LLMs must:\n\n1. **Ask before inventing relations**  \n   - Derive identity, relations, responsibilities from:\n     - User descriptions\n     - Existing docs\n     - Directory and code structure  \n   - If unsure, ask targeted questions rather than filling with feel‑good boilerplate.\n\n2. **Treat moves and refactors as relational changes**  \n   - On major moves/renames of kinship hubs:\n     - Update `Lineage and Relations` in affected `KINSHIP.md` files\n     - Append a short entry in `Accountability and Change Log` that describes the relational meaning (e.g., “service split into two siblings”, “archives moved to a resting place”).\n\n3. **Respect local voice and specificity**  \n   - Preserve user’s own language for people, communities, teachings, places.  \n   - Do not normalize or overwrite Indigenous or ceremonial terms; annotate only if asked.\n\n4. **Hold unresolved tensions explicitly**  \n   - If there are known conflicts or open questions (e.g., consent not yet clarified, clashing obligations), and the user agrees, note them in `Responsibilities and Boundaries` or the change log instead of smoothing them over.\n\n5. **Treat `KINSHIP.md` as a living charter, not a checklist**  \n   - No auto‑regeneration that discards prior commitments.  \n   - Always merge new information into existing structure, unless the user explicitly authorizes a reset.\n\n***\n\n## 5. Kinship Anti‑Patterns LLMs Must Avoid\n\n- Turning `KINSHIP.md` into a generic “README with nicer words”.  \n- Describing only technical dependencies and ignoring people, communities, and more‑than‑human relations when the user has named them elsewhere.  \n- Erasing or rewriting user‑authored kinship text without explicit instruction.  \n- Resolving conflicts or consent questions unilaterally instead of naming them and asking.",

Taking the narrative of “Earning Relational Accountability: A Knowledge Steward’s Journey” as a pedagogical spine, the project treats Sienna’s five‑year learning arc as a teaching story for mapping temporal, spatial and relational obligations in digital knowledge work. The research asks: how can digital infrastructures for language, narrative and environmental knowledge be designed so that they enact, rather than erode, relational accountability to people, place, and ceremony?[1][2][3]\n\nMethodologically, the thesis combines Kaupapa Māori research principles (whanaungatanga, manaakitanga, aroha ki te tangata, kia tūpato, mā te Māori) with Wilson’s concepts of relational accountability, ceremony, and answerability to “all my relations”. It analyses existing Indigenous research methods papers at Waikato (e.g. MAORI570 Te Mahi Rangahau) and wider literature on whakapapa methodology and Indigenous transdisciplinarity to articulate a framework for temporal access, refusal, reciprocity and intergenerational transmission within digital systems.[2][3][4][5][1]\n\nUsing Sienna’s story as an iterative narrative autoethnography, the thesis proposes a set of protocol‑level design principles: knowledge as seasonal and place‑based; refusal as care; community‑held authority over data; ceremony as method for technical decision‑making; and intergenerational stewardship as the measure of research success. These principles are mapped against potential AI and archive architectures, offering criteria by which Indigenous communities and research institutions can evaluate whether proposed digital systems genuinely enact Kaupapa Māori and relational accountability, or merely simulate ethical language.[3][4][1]\n\n\n### Bundle B – MMCT (Māori Media & Communication / Creative Technologies): Practice-Led Ceremonial Systems\n\n**Working title 2**  \nFrom Archive to Longhouse Cloud: Designing Ceremony‑Aware AI Storytellers for Indigenous Language Stewardship  \n\n**Abstract (approx. 200–250 words)**  \nSituated within the Master of Media and Creative Technologies, this creative research project designs and prototypes an AI‑mediated storytelling environment that behaves as a ceremony‑aware participant rather than a neutral tool. Drawing on the narrative of Sienna’s apprenticeship as a digital steward—learning seasonality, reciprocity, refusal, community authority, and intergenerational stewardship—the project asks: what would it mean for an AI system to “know” that knowledge is temporal, place‑based, and relationally governed?[6][7][3]\n\nThe project uses practice‑led research to develop a small suite of audio‑visual works and interactive prototypes: for example, an AI storyteller that enforces seasonal access to recordings; an interface that requires ceremonial acknowledgements before revealing certain narrative layers; and a refusal engine that can say “no” on behalf of the community when requests conflict with protocols. Kaupapa Māori principles and Wilson’s “research is ceremony” paradigm are explicitly encoded as design constraints: access governed by elders, relational logging instead of abstract analytics, and sunset clauses that force periodic community re‑consent for data use.[7][8][1][3]\n\nThe exegesis analyses how creative decisions negotiate tensions between technical possibility, industry AI logics, and Indigenous relational ethics, using Sienna’s story as a recurring reflective mirror. It argues that media/AI systems can be designed as co‑stewards that embody refusal, reciprocity and accountability, offering a model for future Indigenous‑led creative technologies curricula and industry collaborations.[9][3][6][7]\n\n\n### Bundle C – MA Māori & Indigenous Studies + MMCT (sequenced or parallel): Governance and Design of Relational Infrastructures\n\n**Working title 3**  \nGuardians at the Interface: Governance, Refusal and Design in Indigenous‑Led AI Story Stewardship  \n\n**Abstract (approx. 250–300 words)**  \nThis bundle links an MA in Māori & Indigenous Studies with an MMCT project to theorise and materialise governance structures for Indigenous‑controlled AI and media infrastructures. Using “Earning Relational Accountability: A Knowledge Steward’s Journey” as a continuous narrative case, the research focuses on the moments of refusal, funding negotiation, data governance and intergenerational training that mark Sienna’s progression from outsider technician to...\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n- Fixes miadisabelle/Etuaptmumk-RSM#129\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n✨ Let Copilot coding agent [set things up for you](https://github.com/miadisabelle/Etuaptmumk-RSM/issues/new?title=✨+Set+up+Copilot+instructions&body=Configure%20instructions%20for%20this%20repository%20as%20documented%20in%20%5BBest%20practices%20for%20Copilot%20coding%20agent%20in%20your%20repository%5D%28https://gh.io/copilot-coding-agent-tips%29%2E%0A%0A%3COnboard%20this%20repo%3E&assignees=copilot) — coding agent works faster and does higher quality work when set up for your repo.\n",

Kaupapa Māori principles and Wilson’s “research is ceremony” paradigm are explicitly encoded as design constraints: access governed by elders, relational logging instead of abstract analytics, and sunset clauses that force periodic community re‑consent for data use.[7][8][1][3]\n\nThe exegesis analyses how creative decisions negotiate tensions between technical possibility, industry AI logics, and Indigenous relational ethics, using Sienna’s story as a recurring reflective mirror. It argues that media/AI systems can be designed as co‑stewards that embody refusal, reciprocity and accountability, offering a model for future Indigenous‑led creative technologies curricula and industry collaborations.[9][3][6][7]\n\n\n### Bundle C – MA Māori & Indigenous Studies + MMCT (sequenced or parallel): Governance and Design of Relational Infrastructures\n\n**Working title 3**  \nGuardians at the Interface: Governance, Refusal and Design in Indigenous‑Led AI Story Stewardship  \n\n**Abstract (approx. 250–300 words)**  \nThis bundle links an MA in Māori & Indigenous Studies with an MMCT project to theorise and materialise governance structures for Indigenous‑controlled AI and media infrastructures. Using “Earning Relational Accountability: A Knowledge Steward’s Journey” as a continuous narrative case, the research focuses on the moments of refusal, funding negotiation, data governance and intergenerational training that mark Sienna’s progression from outsider technician to named steward.[1][3][7]\n\nThe MA component develops a Kaupapa Māori governance framework for AI‑related research and media projects, grounded in MAORI570 (Te Mahi Rangahau) and related Indigenous research methods papers. It synthesises literature on whakapapa methodology, Indigenous environmental governance, and Wilson’s articulation of relational accountability to propose concrete mechanisms: community‑controlled ethics committees, layered consent protocols, stewardship succession planning, and criteria for declining extractive funding or AI data deals.[4][5][10][3][1]\n\nIn parallel or subsequently, the MMCT component builds a set of media prototypes and design documents that operationalise this governance frame: e.g. interface patterns for collective decision‑making around access; visualisations that show relationships rather than “anonymised data”; and narrative prompts that make refusal intelligible to outside institutions. The project experiments with turning governance principles into user journeys, permissions architectures, and story‑based onboarding for new stewards, echoing Sienna’s training of younger community members.[8][3][7]\n\nTogether, the written thesis and creative portfolio argue for “guardians at the interface” as a new kind of role: knowledge stewards who can translate between Indigenous governance, AI/media design, and institutional demands without sacrificing community sovereignty. Sienna’s story functions as an internal teaching text, modelling how one earns relational accountability over time and how that accountability must be encoded in both policy and code.[3][7][9][1]\n\nSources\n[1] Māori and Indigenous Studies https://www.waikato.ac.nz/study/qualifications/master-of-arts/maori-and-indigenous-studies\n[2] Dr. Shawn Wilson https://drshawnwilson.com\n[3] Research Is Ceremony: Indigenous Research Methods https://fernwoodpublishing.ca/book/research-is-ceremony-shawn-wilson\n[4] Applying whakapapa research methodology in Māori kin communities in Aotearoa New Zealand https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1177083X.2023.2227232?needAccess=true&role=button\n[5] Towards an Indigenous Transdisciplinarity https://www.atlas-tjes.org/index.php/tjes/article/download/97/92\n[6] The University of Waikato Master of Media and Creative Technologies https://www.masterstudies.ng/institutions/universityofwaikato/master-of-media-and-creative-technologies\n[7] Master of Media and Creative Technologies https://www.waikato.ac.nz/study/qualifications/master-of-media-and-creative-technologies\n[8] Master of Media and Creative Technologies https://www.studywithnewzealand.govt.nz/en/study-options/course/21577-course\n[9] Book Review: Research is Ceremony https://astrobites.org/2024/11/29/template-post-35/\n[10] Māori and Indigenous Studies subject regulations https://www.waikato.ac.nz/study/subject-regulations/maori-and-indigenous-studies/\n[11] 260117-st-rcv-8fw-praise-7ce6f-ahAGVf6QTPG06BHPnAvXYw.md https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_49cf4814-4e30-4d4a-b577-2cb7c0693044/184d046e-0f79-450b-8d3a-858811e14de6/260117-st-rcv-8fw-praise-7ce6f-ahAGVf6QTPG06BHPnAvXYw.md\n[12] 260117-rcv-8fw-praise-7ce6f2b1-7Wj3CHWKQnWjmp6GY_WKOA.md https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_49cf4814-4e30-4d4a-b577-2cb7c0693044/eacd9f26-b435-4883-9bf2-a3e18479b9b5/260117-rcv-8fw-praise-7ce6f2b1-7Wj3CHWKQnWjmp6GY_WKOA.md\n[13] Te Wāhi Whangai methodology: A nurturing space for storytelling, achievement and research https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/14733250241300217\n[14] Introducing ‘Ngaruroro’, a New Model for Understanding Māori Wellbeing https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/21/4/445/pdf?version=1712308942\n[15] Autoethnography as a decolonising tool: bringing identity into the classroom https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07294360.2024.2307924\n[16] Restoring the Feminine of Indigenous Environmental Thought https://www.mdpi.com/2313-5778/3/1/11/pdf?version=1553512180\n[17] A short form summary of Takatāpui Beyond Marginalisation: Exploring Māori Gender, Identity and Performance. https://ojs.aut.ac.nz/rangahau-aranga/article/download/146/136\n[18] Navigating wahine Kāi Tahu methodology https://anzswjournal.nz/anzsw/article/download/765/704\n[19] Master's Thesis Regulations https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/documents/policy/research-policy/masters-thesis-regulations.pdf\n[20] Masters Theses and Dissertations :: University of Waikato https://www.waikato.ac.nz/int/students/examinations/assessment/masters-theses-and-dissertations/",

Key programs include the Master of Indigenous Studies at Te Whare Wānanga o Awanuiārangi, the University of Canterbury’s Master of Arts in Māori \\& Indigenous Studies, and Massey University’s Master of Fine Arts (Creative Practice). These programs are designed for artists, educators, and community leaders aiming to integrate cultural identity with advanced research.\n\n### Māori and Indigenous Studies\n\n## OR\n\n### Pacific and Indigenous Studies\n\n## Browse available subjects and choose one for more information\n\n### Anthropology\n\n### English\n\n### Geography\n\n### History\n\n### International Relations\n\n### Māori and Indigenous Studies\n\n### Music\n\n### Pacific and Indigenous Studies\n\n### Philosophy\n\n### Political Science\n\n### Psychology\n\n### Screen and Media Studies\n\n>MAJOR SUBJECT\n\n>Screen and Media Studies at Waikato makes sure you keep pace with new tools and platforms for the rapidly evolving media industry.

Maybe you could draft a claude-code skills that enable agents to fully understand what we are talking about...\n\nI've completed your research on Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) and related agent interoperability standards. Here's what I've prepared:\n\n## Summary of Findings\n\n**The Experimental Commands You Mentioned ARE Real:**\n\n- `gemini --experimental-acp` - Starts Gemini CLI in ACP mode[^1_1][^1_2]\n- `copilot --acp` - Starts GitHub Copilot CLI as an ACP server[^1_3][^1_4][^1_5]\n\nBoth are production features (in public preview) enabling local agents to communicate via standardized protocols.\n\n## Documents Created\n\n### 1. Academic Literature Survey (2 pages)\n\nA focused academic survey covering:\n\n**State of the Field:**\n\n- Four major protocols emerged 2024-2025: MCP, ACP, A2A, ANP\n- Each addresses different interoperability layers (agent↔tools vs agent↔agent)\n- Classification framework: context-oriented vs inter-agent, general vs domain-specific[^1_6][^1_7]\n\n**Current Research Questions:**\n\n1. **Semantic Interoperability** - Extending beyond symbolic reasoning to multimodal data[^1_8]\n2. **Communication Efficiency** - Goal-oriented messaging for resource-constrained environments[^1_9]\n3. **Security \\& Trust** - OAuth2, mTLS, audit trails across protocol lifecycles[^1_7][^1_10]\n4. **Scalability** - Router/supervisor patterns for collective intelligence[^1_11][^1_12]\n5. **Protocol Coexistence** - Phased adoption: MCP→ACP→A2A→ANP[^1_7]\n6. **Dynamic Discovery** - Runtime capability negotiation vs static registries[^1_13][^1_7]\n7. **Standardization** - W3C standardization expected 2026-2027[^1_14]\n\n**Key Insight:** MCP and ACP are *complementary*, not competing. MCP connects agents to tools/data; ACP connects agents to each other.[^1_15][^1_12]\n\n### 2. Practical Implementation Guide\n\nA hands-on resource including:\n\n**Quick Start Commands:**\n\n- Configuration examples for Gemini CLI and Copilot CLI\n- IDE integration (IntelliJ IDEA)[^1_1]\n\n**Essential GitHub Repositories:**\n\n- Official specs: `modelcontextprotocol`, `agentclientprotocol`[^1_16][^1_17]\n- Implementations: `i-am-bee/acp`, `microsoft/mcp`[^1_18][^1_19]\n- Example agents: BeeAI Chat, Slack+MCP, RAG with LlamaIndex[^1_20]\n\n**SDK Implementations:**\n\n- Python: `acp-sdk-python` (enterprise-ready)[^1_10]\n- TypeScript: `@agentclientprotocol/sdk`[^1_17]\n- Rust, Kotlin: Full-featured SDKs available[^1_17]\n\n**Step-by-Step Tutorial:**\nComplete walkthrough from choosing a framework to deploying your first ACP agent with OAuth2 security.\n\n**Claude-Code Skill:**\nA structured skill definition enabling agents to fully understand ACP, MCP, and multi-agent architectures.\n\n## Key Architectural Patterns for Your Local Agents\n\n**Pattern 1: MCP + ACP Hybrid (Recommended)**\n\n```\nYour Agent uses MCP to access tools/data\n          uses ACP to coordinate with other agents\n```\n\n**Pattern 2: Router Agent with Specialists**\n\n```\nRouter Agent decomposes tasks\n    → Data Agent\n    → Code Agent  \n    → Research Agent\n```\n\n**Pattern 3: Discovery via Agent Cards**\n\n```\nHTTP GET /.well-known/agent.json\nReturns: capabilities, authentication, endpoints\n```\n\n\n## Academic Foundation\n\n**Must-Read Papers:**\n\n1. Yang et al. (2025) - \"A Survey of AI Agent Protocols\" (arXiv:2504.16736)[^1_6]\n2. Ehtesham et al. (2025) - \"Survey of Agent Interoperability Protocols\" (arXiv:2505.02279)[^1_7]\n3. Yan et al. (2025) - \"Beyond Self-Talk: Communication-Centric Survey\" (arXiv:2502.14321)[^1_21]\n\n**Historical Context:**\n\n- FIPA-ACL (2000): IEEE standard based on speech act theory[^1_22][^1_23]\n- Modern protocols build on these foundations but optimize for LLM agents\n\n\n## Timeline and Predictions\n\n**2025-2026:** Protocol convergence, W3C standardization begins\n**2026-2027:** Domain-specific variants (healthcare, finance), edge/IoT protocols\n**2027-2030:** Universal standard emerges (\"HTTP for agents\"), agent marketplaces[^1_14]\n\n## Next Steps for Your Local Agents\n\n1. **Experiment** with `gemini --experimental-acp` or `copilot --acp`\n2. **Install** Python SDK: `pip install acp-sdk-python`\n3. **Study** example implementations at agentcommunicationprotocol.dev[^1_24]\n4. **Build** your first agent following the step-by-step guide\n5. **Integrate** MCP servers for tool access[^1_25][^1_18]\n\nThe documents provide everything needed for local agents to self-educate on agent communication protocols, from theoretical foundations to production deployment patterns.\n<span

Not autonomous agents, but relational participants in K'é (kinship).\n\n**Current Reality**:\n- IAIP Instance (South - Planning) - Session e5672908-8249-4111-b8ef-9c483745597d\n- Apps Instance (not positioned) - Session d59e4c89-d133-433a-b9f7-91cffe0d651f\n- TCC Instance (potential East - Narrative)\n\n**Desired Outcome**: \nCoordinated multi-perspective synthesis where each instance contributes from its positioned perspective.\n\n## Integration with mia-code (#332)\n\nThe fork protocol directly supports mia-code's trinity convergence vision:\n- **miaco** (Mia - Engineer) handles structural tensions\n- **miatel** (Miette - Story) manages narrative beats  \n- **miawa** (Ava8 - Ceremony) coordinates relational practices\n\nCross-instance collaboration enables these three universes to work together through forked sessions rather than isolated tool invocations.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Execute fork protocol with Apps instance\n2. Test kinship hub coordination patterns\n3. Document cross-instance synthesis outcomes\n4. Refine ceremonial positioning for each instance\n5. Archive learnings in this issue\n\n## Session Rehydration\n\n```bash\n# Original session launch\n/src/IAIP/prototypes/artefacts/LAUNCH.2602032052.475911cd-8ab8-4ed8-b687-5e4422042058.sh\n\n# Current fork session (Apps)\n/b/Dropbox/Apps/RESUME_2602031712.sh\n# Session: bacd0836-e2cf-43a8-b079-e8c43b2b378a\n```\n\n## Winter Solstice Narrative Connection\n\nThis experimentation emerged during Winter Solstice 2026 work exploring Relational AI paradigm shifts. The academic foundation (47 problem domains, RAI outperforming Autonomous AI by 287%) supports the technical implementation of relational architectures through session forking and kinship coordination.\n\n**Narrative Files** (renamed Feb 3):\n- `academic-sci-fi—2602031649–William-journal--jgwill--src--359--2602031512-*.txt` (Parts 1-4)\n- `tushell-sci-fi—2602031649–William-journal--jgwill--src--359--2602031512-*.txt`\n\nArchive: `/b/Dropbox/stories/winter_solstice/tmp260203–sci-fi/`\n\n---\n\n**Labels**: inquiry, iaip, cross-instance, four-directions, winter-solstice, session-management",

The system separates functional execution (primary Gemini agent) from reflective interpretation (Claude-powered Unifier), creating a natural site for character emergence.[^1_1]\n\n**Implementation Sequence:**\n\n1. **Persona Prompt Library Structure** (`/src/mia-code/src/personas/`)\n    - Create modular system prompt files as TypeScript constants\n    - Each character exports: `CHARACTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `CHARACTER_BACKSTORY`, `CHARACTER_VOICE_PATTERNS`\n    - Example structure: `skeptical-engineer.persona.ts`, `whimsical-storyteller.persona.ts`\n2. **Configuration Schema Evolution** (`/src/mia-code/src/config.ts`)\n\n```typescript\ninterface MiaCodeConfig {\n  activePersona: string;\n  personaMemoryDepth: 'session' | 'persistent' | 'ephemeral';\n  narrativeCoherence: 'strict' | 'flexible';\n}\n```\n\n3. **Dynamic Prompt Selection Engine** (`/src/mia-code/src/unifier.ts`)\n    - Implement `PersonaRegistry` class with character lookup\n    - Add `loadPersonaPrompt(personaId: string)` function\n    - Integrate session-aware context injection before Claude invocation\n4. **CLI Surface Expansion** (`/src/mia-code/src/cli.ts`)\n\n```\n- Flags: `--persona <name>`, `--list-personas`, `--persona-info <name>`\n```\n\n    - Interactive persona selection mode for first-time users\n5. **Character Memory Integration** (`/src/mia-code/src/sessionStore.ts`)\n    - Extend storage schema: `{ sessionId, personaId, characterMemories[], narrativeState }`\n    - Implement `CharacterMemoryManager` for cross-session retrieval\n    - Add semantic similarity search for relevant past interactions\n\n### Prototype Character Specification\n\n**Proposed First Character: \"The Skeptical Cartographer\"**\n\n- **Core Function:** Maps conceptual territories while questioning assumptions\n- **Voice Pattern:** Tentative phrasing (\"Perhaps...\", \"This suggests, though...\"), frequent meta-commentary\n- **Memory Bias:** Prioritizes contradictions and edge cases from previous sessions\n- **Interaction Style:** Responds to certainty with doubt, to vagueness with structural questions\n\n\n## Academic Research Foundations\n\n### Research Question Formulation\n\n**Primary RQ:** How do architectural patterns for agent persona management in dual-session LLM systems enable persistent narrative characterization that maintains coherence across context boundaries while supporting dynamic character development?\n\n**Secondary RQs:**\n\n1. What memory architectures best support character continuity in stateless LLM interactions?\n2. How does the separation of functional and interpretive agents affect narrative consistency compared to monolithic character implementations?\n3. What role does prompt engineering versus external memory play in perceived character authenticity?\n\n### Theoretical Framework Integration\n\n**Computational Narratology Foundations**\n\nThe field examines algorithmic processes for creating and interpreting narratives through formal, computable representations. Your architecture embodies a narratological structure: the primary agent generates the fabula (event sequence), while the Unifier constructs the sjuzhet (narrative discourse).[^1_2][^1_3][^1_4]\n\nRecent work on multi-agent narrative systems demonstrates that LLMs can simulate nuanced characters when backed by memory of past interactions. Character consistency emerges from three architectural components: role-playing with memory, narrative coherence constraints, and persona-aware rewriting.[^1_5]\n\n**Memory Architecture Patterns**\n\nCurrent research identifies critical memory tiers for LLM agents:[^1_6][^1_7]\n\n- **Core memory** (in-context, analogous to RAM): Character defining traits, immediate conversation\n- **Archival memory** (vector store, analogous to disk): Past interaction embeddings, character experiences\n- **Entity memory**: Structured capture of relationships, places, concepts tied to character knowledge\n\nYour `sessionStore.ts` provides foundation for this hierarchy. MemGPT's approach of treating context as constrained resource with explicit memory management functions offers a proven pattern.[^1_7][^1_1]\n\n**Persona Consistency Research**\n\nStudies on personality consistency in conversational agents reveal that static predefined personas create \"out-of-predefined persona\" (OOP) problems when agents encounter queries beyond their initial description. Solutions involve:[^1_8][^1_9]\n\n- Dynamic persona retrieval from global collections based on dialogue context\n- Natural Language Inference (NLI) models to ensure new persona elements align with core traits\n- Posterior-scored architectures that weight persona relevance during generation\n\nYour dual-session architecture naturally supports this: the Unifier can dynamically adjust interpretive framing based on retrieved character memories without altering the primary agent's functional execution.[^1_1]\n\n### Narrative Theory Convergence\n\n**Agent-to-Agent Communication as Narrative Protocol**\n\nYour interest in A2A protocols and Narrative Context Protocol (NCP) aligns with emerging work on computational narrative understanding. Recent frameworks model narrative as information flow from narrator to reader, where reader uncertainty and story model evolution become computable.[^1_10][^1_11][^1_12]\n\nThe Unifier functions as a computational narrator: it receives event summaries (fabula) and constructs character-filtered discourse (sjuzhet). This maps directly to narrative communication models where narration mediates between story world and audience.[^1_3]\n\n**Indigenous Epistemology and Two-Perspective Architecture**\n\nYour Etuaptmumk (Two-Eyed Seeing) integration finds technical expression in the Mia/Miette duality. This ceremonial dual-perspective approach resonates with narrative theory on multiple focalization: the primary agent provides external focalization (events), while character-specific Unifiers offer internal focalization (interpretation).[^1_3][^1_1]\n\nComputational approaches to narratives with non-human narrators explore how abstraction enables defamiliarization of anthropocentric assumptions. Your architecture's separation of \"doer\" and \"reflector\" creates space for non-Western narrative epistemologies to inform agent characterization.[^1_3]\n\n### Literature Gaps and Contributions\n\n**Identified Research Gaps:**\n\n1. Most persona-based agents use monolithic architectures; dual-session approaches remain underexplored[^1_5][^1_8]\n2. Character memory systems focus on factual retrieval; narrative state and emotional continuity receive less attention[^1_13][^1_6]\n3. Computational narratology emphasizes plot structure over character interiority[^1_14][^1_15][^1_2]\n4. Agent personality research centers on chat consistency; character development over time is minimal[^1_16][^1_17]\n\n**Your System's Novel Contributions:**\n\n- **Architectural separation** of functional cognition from narrative interpretation enables character layering without compromising task performance\n- **Session-aware memory** infrastructure provides foundation for character development narratives across interactions\n- **Ceremonial framing** (Miawa Unifier concept) brings indigenous epistemology into computational narrative generation\n- **CLI-based character selection** democratizes access to narrative AI without GUI complexity\n\n\n## Article Structure Proposal\n\n### Title Options\n\n1. \"Dual-Session Architecture for Persistent Character Simulation in LLM-Based CLI Agents\"\n2. \"From Functional Persona to Narrative Character: Memory and Architecture in Multi-Agent Systems\"\n3. \"Ceremonial Computation: Two-Eyed Seeing in Agent Character Design\"\n\n### Proposed Sections\n\n**I.

The dual-session architecture you've built is well-aligned with emerging work on agent memory and computational narratology, while your indigenous epistemology integration offers a genuinely novel contribution to the field.\n\nThe software pathway is concrete and modular: persona prompt library → config extension → dynamic selection → memory integration → CLI exposure. Each phase builds on existing infrastructure without requiring architectural rewrites.\n\nThe academic pathway positions this work at the intersection of computational narratology, agent memory systems, and indigenous knowledge integration—a space with clear research gaps and strong theoretical foundations. The proposed evaluation combines technical metrics (consistency, coherence) with human factors (believability, engagement) and cultural dimensions (ceremonial framing, non-Western narrative structures).\n<span style=\"display:none\">[^1_20][^1_21][^1_22][^1_23][^1_24][^1_25][^1_26][^1_27][^1_28][^1_29][^1_30][^1_31][^1_32][^1_33][^1_34]</span>\n\n<div align=\"center\">⁂</div>\n\n[^1_1]: persona-to-narrative-character-inquiry_260201.md\n\n[^1_2]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00481\n\n[^1_3]: https://muse.jhu.edu/article/980959\n\n[^1_4]: https://www-archiv.fdm.uni-hamburg.de/lhn/node/43.html\n\n[^1_5]: https://aclanthology.org/2025.in2writing-1.9.pdf\n\n[^1_6]: https://serokell.io/blog/design-patterns-for-long-term-memory-in-llm-powered-architectures\n\n[^1_7]: https://www.letta.com/blog/agent-memory\n\n[^1_8]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10816\n\n[^1_9]: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=90KaW3XjgRq\n\n[^1_10]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.12872.pdf\n\n[^1_11]: https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2021.nuse-1.10\n\n[^1_12]: https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.26.pdf\n\n[^1_13]: https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/persistent-memory-for-llm-agents\n\n[^1_14]: https://www.scitepress.org/DigitalLibrary/Link.aspx?doi=10.5220/0013369600003890\n\n[^1_15]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07010\n\n[^1_16]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563225002067\n\n[^1_17]: https://cetas.turing.ac.uk/publications/patterns-not-people-personality-structures-llm-powered-persona-agents\n\n[^1_18]: https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.conll-1.42.pdf\n\n[^1_19]: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5165274\n\n[^1_20]: https://data.doi.or.kr/10.23362/KOEN2025.07.25.1.031\n\n[^1_21]: https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/17/5265\n\n[^1_22]: http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/978-1-5225-0432-0.ch001\n\n[^1_23]: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c750fb0623c1a4c9cd53c59e0d2381cef5278b45\n\n[^1_24]: http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2024.06.04.595972\n\n[^1_25]: https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4426/15/7/298\n\n[^1_26]: https://arxiv.org/html/2503.23512v1\n\n[^1_27]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04844.pdf\n\n[^1_28]: https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-6602.pdf\n\n[^1_29]: https://arxiv.org/html/2405.13042v2\n\n[^1_30]: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/computational-humanities-research/announcements/call-for-papers/computational-narratology\n\n[^1_31]: https://www.scitepress.org/publishedPapers/2025/133696/pdf/index.html\n\n[^1_32]: https://journal.accsindia.org/show.article.php?id=59\n\n[^1_33]: https://www.uib.no/sites/w3.uib.no/files/attachments/ai-stories-b1-erc_adg.pdf\n\n[^1_34]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1875952125001570",

PDE helps agentic terminals evolve to handle multi-part requests.\n\n     ## Problem Statement\n    \n     Complex user inputs often contain:\n     - Multiple implicit intentions\n     - Nested requirements\n     - Action sequences\n     - Context that requires cross-referencing\n     - NCP entity relationships\n    \n     Without decomposition, agents may:\n     - Ignore secondary intentions\n     - Miss implicit requirements\n     - Fail to track multi-step progress\n     - Lose context between actions\n    </context>\n\nin such a way I would have a sets of steps that would use prompt layering (workflow or something) to decompose what I initially sent.  also survey academic literature and produce a literature survey to accompagny this potential new library that will be part of our various terminal-agents (like claude-code, gemini-cli, copilot-cli) that we will create and that library will help them do an adequate job\n\nI'll now develop a detailed implementation plan and literature survey for the PDE (Prompt Decomposition Engine) generalization, building on what you've started and incorporating relevant academic research.\n\n# PDE Generalization: Implementation Strategy \\& Academic Literature Survey\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe Prompt Decomposition Engine (PDE) represents a critical infrastructure component for next-generation terminal agents (claude-code, gemini-cli, copilot-cli). By systematically decomposing complex, multi-intent prompts into executable workflows, PDE addresses fundamental limitations in current agentic systems: implicit intention blindness, context fragmentation, and sequential dependency failures.[^1_1][^1_2]\n\nThis document provides: (1) a layered implementation strategy using prompt chaining and workflow orchestration, (2) a literature survey grounding PDE in academic research on task decomposition, intent parsing, and multi-agent coordination, and (3) integration specifications for terminal-agent architectures.\n\n***\n\n## Part 1: Implementation Strategy - Layered Workflow Architecture\n\n### Architecture Overview\n\nThe PDE system operates through **five progressive layers** that transform raw user input into executable agent workflows:\n\n```\nLayer 1: Intent Extraction & Classification\n    ↓\nLayer 2: Dependency Graph Construction\n    ↓\nLayer 3: Medicine Wheel Direction Assignment\n    ↓\nLayer 4: Workflow Template Generation\n    ↓\nLayer 5: Execution Plan with Checkpoints\n```\n\n\n### Layer 1: Intent Extraction \\& Classification\n\n**Purpose**: Parse raw prompt into structured intent objects using NLU techniques.[^1_3][^1_4][^1_5]\n\n**Academic Foundation**:\n\n- **Intent recognition** identifies user goals from natural language[^1_6][^1_5]\n- **Entity recognition** extracts actionable objects and parameters[^1_4]\n- Multi-intent parsing handles compound requests[^1_5]\n\n**Implementation via Prompt Chaining**:[^1_7][^1_8]\n\n```typescript\n// Sequential chaining for intent extraction\nconst intentExtractionChain = {\n  \n  // Step 1: Explicit Action Identification\n  step1: {\n    prompt: `Analyze this user request and identify ALL explicit action verbs:\n    \n    \"${userPrompt}\"\n    \n    For each action, extract:\n    - Action verb (create, update, analyze, design, etc.)\n    - Target object (file, system, component, etc.)\n    - Implicit parameters or constraints\n    \n    Output as JSON array of {action, target, constraints}`,\n    \n    parser: (output) => parseJSON(output)\n  },\n  \n  // Step 2: Implicit Intent Discovery\n  step2: {\n    prompt: `Given these explicit actions: ${step1.result}\n    \n    Now identify IMPLICIT requirements in the original request:\n    \n    \"${userPrompt}\"\n    \n    Look for:\n    - \"which I assume\" → assumptions requiring validation\n    - \"you will\" → expectations without explicit instruction\n    - \"somehow\" → uncertainty markers\n    - \"I expect\" → unstated success criteria\n    - Dependencies on external context\n    \n    Output as JSON array of {implicitIntent, triggerPhrase, priority}`,\n    \n    parser: (output) => parseJSON(output)\n  },\n  \n  // Step 3: Intent Classification\n  step3: {\n    prompt: `Classify each intent by type:\n    \n    Explicit intents: ${step1.result}\n    Implicit intents: ${step2.result}\n    \n    Categories:\n    - CREATION (generate new artifacts)\n    - MODIFICATION (update existing)\n    - ANALYSIS (investigate/understand)\n    - VALIDATION (verify/test)\n    - INTEGRATION (connect systems)\n    - COMMUNICATION (notifications/reports)\n    \n    Output as JSON: {intentId, type, confidence}`,\n    \n    parser: (output) => parseJSON(output)\n  }\n};\n```\n\n**Key Techniques**:\n\n- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting**: Forces step-by-step reasoning[^1_9][^1_10][^1_11]\n- **Decomposed prompting**: Breaks complex analysis into modular sub-tasks[^1_12][^1_13]\n- **ReAct pattern**: Alternates reasoning (Think) with action (Extract)[^1_14][^1_15][^1_16]\n\n***\n\n### Layer 2: Dependency Graph Construction\n\n**Purpose**: Map inter-intent dependencies to determine execution order and parallelization opportunities.\n\n**Academic Foundation**:\n\n- Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) for recursive decomposition[^1_17][^1_18]\n- Task allocation via precedence constraints[^1_18]\n- Agent-oriented planning with sub-task dependencies[^1_19]\n\n**Implementation via Branching Chains**:[^1_8]\n\n```typescript\n// Branching chain for dependency analysis\nconst dependencyAnalysisChain = {\n  \n  // Primary analysis\n  step1: {\n    prompt: `Given these classified intents:\n    ${JSON.stringify(classifiedIntents)}\n    \n    Build a dependency graph:\n    \n    For each intent, determine:\n    1.

By synthesizing academic advances in task decomposition, prompt engineering, and workflow orchestration with indigenous epistemological frameworks (Medicine Wheel/Etuaptmumk), PDE provides terminal agents with structured, transparent, and culturally-grounded decomposition capabilities.[^1_18][^1_16][^1_20][^1_27][^1_10][^1_17][^1_7]\n\nThe 5-layer architecture—Intent Extraction, Dependency Graphing, Wheel Assignment, Workflow Generation, and Execution Planning—operationalizes prompt chaining and meta-prompting research into a production-ready library. Integration with JGT-Code, Claude-Code, Gemini-CLI, and Copilot-CLI terminal agents will demonstrate real-world applicability.\n\nThis work contributes both to AI systems engineering (practical decomposition infrastructure) and to AI ethics/epistemology (indigenous knowledge integration), positioning PDE as a bridge between computational efficiency and cultural responsibility in agentic AI development.\n<span

to the Prompt Decomposition Engine (PDE) project. Its purpose is to assist other LLMs in quickly understanding the available research, its relevance to PDE's architecture and implementation, and its contribution to the overall literature survey.\n\nThe PDE aims to decompose complex, multi-intent prompts into actionable workflows, addressing limitations in current agentic systems. This literature base supports the development of PDE's five progressive layers: Intent Extraction & Classification, Dependency Graph Construction, Medicine Wheel Direction Assignment, Workflow Template Generation, and Execution Plan with Checkpoints, as well as its academic grounding.\n\n## Processed Literature References:\n\nHere is an overview of the academic papers that have been processed and converted into Markdown, along with their key relevance to the PDE project:\n\n1.  **[Decomposed Prompting: A Modular Approach For Solving Complex Tasks](sources/footnote_1_12_decomposed_prompting.md)**\n    *   **Original Source:** `https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.02406.pdf`\n    *   **Relevance to PDE:** Directly relevant to the core concept of PDE, especially Layer 1 (Intent Extraction) and Layer 4 (Workflow Template Generation). This paper explores decomposing complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks via prompting, utilizing a shared library of LLMs. It highlights advantages like modularity, debuggability, and extensibility, which are foundational principles for PDE's layered architecture and prompt chaining approach. It also discusses hierarchical and recursive decomposition, which aligns with PDE's dependency graph construction.\n\n2.  **[Navigating Complexity: Orchestrated Problem Solving with Multi-Agent LLMs](sources/footnote_1_2_navigating_complexity.md)**\n    *   **Original Source:** `http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16713.pdf`\n    *   **Relevance to PDE:** Highly relevant to PDE's overall architecture and Layer 4 (Workflow Template Generation). This paper proposes leveraging decomposition and an orchestrating LLM to tackle complex and vague problems in multi-agent systems. It details how an orchestrating LLM can decompose problems, ask follow-up questions, and assign sub-problems to specialized agents, directly mirroring PDE's goal of transforming raw user input into executable agent workflows within a multi-agent context.\n\n3.  **[LLM Multi-Agent Systems: Challenges and Open Problems](sources/footnote_1_1_coordination_challenges.md)**\n    *   **Original Source:** `https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03578.pdf`\n    *   **Relevance to PDE:** Provides critical context for PDE's operational environment, specifically informing Layer 2 (Dependency Graph Construction), Layer 5 (Execution Plan with Checkpoints), and the \"Multi-Agent Systems Challenges\" section of the literature survey. It discusses challenges in multi-agent systems such as task allocation, robust reasoning, managing complex context, and memory management. Understanding these challenges is essential for designing a resilient and effective PDE.\n\n4.  **[MARCO: Multi-Agent Real-time Chat Orchestration](sources/footnote_1_28_guardrails_multi_agent.md)**\n    *   **Original Source:** `https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21784.pdf`\n    *   **Relevance to PDE:** Very relevant to Layer 5 (Execution Plan with Checkpoints) and the \"Multi-Agent Systems Challenges\" section, particularly concerning guardrails and error recovery. This paper introduces a framework for automating tasks in multi-agent LLM systems, emphasizing robust guardrails to steer LLM behavior, validate outputs, and recover from errors. These concepts are directly applicable to building reliable execution plans and checkpointing mechanisms within PDE.\n\n5.  **[TOWARDS HIERARCHICAL MULTI-AGENT WORKFLOWS FOR ZERO-SHOT PROMPT OPTIMIZATION](sources/footnote_1_34_hierarchical_multi_agent.md)**\n    *   **Original Source:** `https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20252.pdf`\n    *   **Relevance to PDE:** Directly relevant to Prompt Engineering for Decomposition and Workflow Orchestration, impacting Layer 1 (Intent Extraction) and Layer 4 (Workflow Template Generation). This paper explores giving LLMs the freedom to design optimal prompts hierarchically (CEO → Manager → Worker workflow). This zero-shot, task-agnostic, and query-specific approach to prompt optimization offers insights into how PDE can dynamically generate and refine prompts for its various decomposition layers.\n\n6.  **[Agent-Oriented Planning in Multi-Agent Systems](sources/footnote_1_19_hugginggpt_planning.md)**\n    *   **Original Source:** `https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02189v2.pdf`\n    *   **Relevance to PDE:** Highly relevant to Layer 2 (Dependency Graph Construction) and Layer 4 (Workflow Template Generation), as well as general Multi-Agent Systems Challenges. This paper identifies design principles for agent-oriented planning (solvability, completeness, non-redundancy) and proposes AOP, a framework for fast task decomposition and allocation with reward model-based evaluation and feedback loops. This directly informs how PDE can structure its sub-task assignments and ensure effective multi-agent collaboration.\n\n7.  **[Open Intent Extraction from Natural Language Interactions (Extended Abstract)](sources/footnote_1_5_open_intent_extraction.md)**\n    *   **Original Source:** `https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/0663.pdf`\n    *   **Relevance to PDE:** Directly relevant to Layer 1 (Intent Extraction & Classification) and the \"Intent Recognition & NLU\" section of the literature survey. This paper introduces OPINE, a domain-agnostic approach for open intent discovery, framing it as a sequence tagging task. Understanding how to extract explicit and implicit user intents from diverse natural language inputs is fundamental to PDE's initial layer of decomposing prompts.\n\n8.  **[Agents Under Siege: Breaking Pragmatic Multi-Agent LLM Systems with Optimized Prompt Attacks](sources/2504.00218v2.md)**\n    *   **Original Source:** `https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00218v2.pdf`\n    *   **Relevance to PDE:** Provides critical context for the \"Communication Vulnerabilities\" within \"Multi-Agent Systems Challenges\" (Section 3.5) of PDE's literature survey. This paper discusses adversarial attacks and prompt propagation in multi-agent LLM systems, highlighting vulnerabilities in inter-agent communication. While not directly about constructive prompt decomposition, understanding these attack vectors can inform the design of robust and secure PDE implementations, particularly regarding prompt sanitization and communication protocols.\n\n9.  **[Which Agent Causes Task Failures and When? On Automated Failure Attribution of LLM Multi-Agent Systems](sources/2505.00212v3.md)**\n    *   **Original Source:** `https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00212v3.pdf`\n    *   **Relevance to PDE:** Highly relevant and foundational for Layer 5 (Execution Plan with Checkpoints) and the \"Failure Attribution\" section (Section 3.5) of PDE's literature survey. This paper directly addresses automated failure attribution in multi-agent LLM systems, including identifying agents and steps responsible for task failures. This knowledge is crucial for developing PDE's capabilities for progress tracking, precise failure diagnosis, and effective recovery mechanisms.",

The review identifies a critical gap: while robust work exists in narrative generation, multi-agent systems, and tool orchestration independently, no prior literature addresses the integration of these domains through an epistemologically grounded, narrative-aware tool registry. This positions the proposed work at the intersection of Three distinct research vectors: (1) epistemology-driven system design (Two-Eyed Seeing, Abundant Intelligences), (2) narrative coherence maintenance (NCP, constraint satisfaction approaches), and (3) declarative, scalable tool ecosystems (MCP, plugin architectures).\n\n---\n\n## 1. Indigenous Epistemologies and Technology Design\n\n### 1.1 Abundant Intelligences: Epistemology as Foundation\n\nLewis, Whaanga, and Yolgörmez (2025) present *Abundant Intelligences*, an Indigenous-led research program that fundamentally reframes AI development by grounding it in Indigenous knowledge systems rather than Western rationalist epistemologies.[40] Their critique identifies the core problem: mainstream AI suffers from epistemological shortcomings that systematize bias against non-white, non-male, and non-Western peoples.\n\nThe researchers argue that current AI definitions of intelligence—exemplified by Legg and Hutter's influential formulation (\"the general ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments\")—treat intelligence as a *property* of isolated individuals rather than as a relational, contextual phenomenon. This individualistic, abstraction-driven framing excludes vital aspects of human existence: trust, care, community, embodiment, and emotional resonance. Furthermore, the intellectual lineage underlying AI design contains \"Cartesian duality, monotheistic eschatology, and computational reductionism\"—all of which impoverish what intelligence means.\n\nAbundant Intelligences proposes three research axes to rebuild AI's foundations:\n\n- **Integrations**: Building relations across disciplines and communities to establish cultural repertoires for heterogeneous components to connect\n- **Imaginaries**: Exploring novel conceptions through speculative design of Indigenous AI\n- **Intelligences**: Bringing Indigenous perspectives to technical AI challenges through critical–technical practice and prototyping\n\nCrucially, their framework treats innovation as grounded in *regeneration*, not extraction. Indigenous knowledge systems provide \"thousands of years of research and practice from cultures that have proven that regenerative thinking is possible.\"[40]\n\n### 1.2 Indigenous Knowledge Integration Framework\n\nChung et al. (2024) propose a systematic framework for integrating Indigenous knowledge into IT artifact design through three pathways:[135]\n\n1. **Path A (Direct use)**: Indigenous knowledge directly embedded in artifact design (e.g., domain ontologies for Indigenous drought forecasting)\n2. **Path B (Foundational theories)**: Indigenous theories inform artifact design principles\n3. **Path C (Meta-level artifacts)**: Creation of Indigenous theories for IT artifact design itself\n\nThe Kaupapa Māori Modelled IT Artefact model exemplifies Path C, emphasizing: language alignment, relationship protocols, engagement design criteria that respect tribal authority. This model demonstrates how to instantiate Indigenous epistemology—not as an overlay—but as the *design prerequisite*.\n\n### 1.3 Two-Eyed Seeing: Etuaptmumk Framework\n\nAlbert and Murdena Marshall (Mi'kmaq Elders) and Cheryl Bartlett developed *Two-Eyed Seeing* (Mi'kmaq: *Etuaptmumk*) as a methodological approach for viewing the world \"from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous ways of knowing, and to see from the other eye with the strengths of Western ways of knowing, and to use both of these eyes together.\"[170][173]\n\nRather than assimilating one knowledge system into another or creating a clash between them, Two-Eyed Seeing operationalizes *binocular vision*: both perspectives retain their integrity while operating in complementary relationship.\n\nThe framework embeds four essential elements:[164]\n\n1. **Co-Learning**: Learning together across knowledge systems\n2. **Knowledge Scrutinization**: Seeing \"the best\" from each perspective\n3. **Knowledge Validation**: Peer validation grounded in each system's criteria\n4. **Knowledge Gardening**: Walking the talk through grounded, actionable projects\n\nMedical research applications demonstrate key principles:[167] relationship building, community control, collaborative data analysis, shared results interpretation, inclusion of Indigenous advisory committees, continuous community guidance, and meaningful long-term relationships.\n\nCritically, Knowledge Gardening introduces temporal depth—seeding, nurturing, and growing information over timeframes that exceed typical Western research-grant cycles, creating culturally rooted analysis that resonates with partnering communities' worldviews.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Narrative Intelligence and System Architecture\n\n### 2.1 Narrative Context Protocol: Encoding Narrative Intent\n\nThe Narrative Context Protocol (NCP) represents a foundational advance in narrative-aware system specification.[114][139] Rather than treating narrative as emergent output from unconstrained generative systems, NCP encodes story structure in a \"Storyform\"—a structured register of narrative features—that enables:\n\n- **Narrative portability**: Stories maintain coherence across different generation systems\n- **Intent-based constraints**: Authorial voice and thematic intent constrain agent actions without rigidly dictating them\n- **Agency preservation**: Constraints enable generative systems to accommodate player/user agency while maintaining narrative context\n\nIn the year-long experiment cited, an author used NCP with a custom platform to create a playable, text-based experience driven by generative AI with unconstrained natural language input. NCP functioned as \"guardrails\" ensuring narrative coherence and context preservation—a critical distinction from traditional rails-based systems that sacrifice player agency for plot rigidity.\n\nThis represents the *narrative dimension* of the tool registry problem: tools must not only be discoverable and executable, but their invocation must respect narrative context and authorial intent.\n\n### 2.2 Narrative Intelligence Theory\n\nMateas and Sengers (1998) establish theoretical foundations for understanding systems that comprehend and generate stories.[74] Their work on \"narrative intelligence\" defines agents capable of engaging with narrative structures—understanding stories, reasoning about plot coherence, character consistency, and thematic resonance.\n\nContemporary work extends this into practical systems. Klover AI's \"Narrative Intelligence\" framework demonstrates how AI can identify compelling narrative structure (challenge → conflict → transformation) and frame ideas as stories rather than lists of features.[71] This is strategic storytelling—guided by intention and intelligence—where narrative becomes a primary medium for meaning-making, not merely an output format.\n\n### 2.3 Multi-Agent Creative Storytelling\n\nRecent work demonstrates that multi-agent approaches generate narratives superior to monolithic models:\n\n**Character-Based Simulation** (Yu et al., 2025): Multi-agent story-generation decomposes elaboration into role-play and rewrite steps, where LLM-backed character agents enact stories chronologically before refinement aligns output with narrative plans.[131] This produces more believable characters and surprising plot developments than direct generation.\n\n**Agents' Room** (Huot et al., 2024): Decomposes narrative writing into specialized agent subtasks inspired by narrative theory.[140] Expert evaluators prefer stories from this specialized multi-agent framework over baseline systems because collaboration and role specialization render complex writing tractable.\n\n**AI-Driven Storytelling** (2025): Multi-agent approaches with autonomous agents possessing identity, memory, and goals produce \"far more believable, consistent characters and surprising plot developments\" because agents reason about their own goals and prior experiences.[137]\n\n---\n\n## 3. Tool Orchestration and Registry Patterns\n\n### 3.1 Registry Pattern Fundamentals\n\nThe Registry Pattern provides a structural foundation for centralized object/service management.[66] Core principles include:\n\n- **Centralized Management**: Single repository promotes uniform access, control, and update mechanisms\n- **Decoupling**: Components depend on registry interfaces rather than concrete implementations\n- **Runtime Configuration**: Dynamic behavior without codebase modification\n- **Reusability**: Shared instances reduce redundancy and improve resource utilization\n\nHowever, registry patterns also introduce known challenges: global state management risks, potential tight coupling to the registry itself, and performance bottlenecks under high concurrency. Sophisticated implementations require clear responsibility boundaries, strong interfaces, thread-safe implementations, and robust error handling.\n\n### 3.2 Plugin Architecture Design Pattern\n\nPlugin architectures extend registry concepts by formalizing extensibility as a first-class design principle.[70] Core components:\n\n- **Host Application**: Provides foundational features and plugin management\n- **Plugin Interface**: Standardized contract between host and extensions\n- **Plugin Registry**: Dynamic loading, lifecycle management, dependency resolution\n- **Extensibility Points**: Well-defined integration surfaces\n\nBenefits include modularity, parallel development, easy maintenance, and user customization. Challenges center on performance overhead (especially with many plugins), complex dependency management, and security implications of dynamic code loading.\n\n### 3.3 Model Context Protocol (MCP): Current Standard\n\nThe Model Context Protocol emerges as the de facto standard for LLM-tool integration, achieving 8+ million weekly SDK downloads by late 2024.[81][105]\n\n**Architecture**: MCP provides a JSON-RPC client-server interface enabling standardized, bidirectional communication between AI models and external tools/resources. Key capabilities:\n\n- **Tools**: Extend agent mode with specialized, domain-specific capabilities\n- **Prompts**: Add reusable prompt templates as slash commands\n- **Resources**: Provide data/content for chat context or direct interaction\n- **Sampling**: Make language model requests using configured models\n- **Authentication**: OAuth-based authorization for tool access\n- **Server Instructions**: Communicate tool capabilities and constraints\n\n**Lifecycle**: MCP lifecycle encompasses four phases—creation, deployment, operation, and maintenance—decomposed into 16 key activities.[81]\n\n**Security Landscape**: Significant security research identifies critical threats:[82][83][84][87][90]\n\n- **Tool Poisoning**: Malicious tools injected into agent workflows\n- **Rug Pull Attacks**: Compromised tool servers exfiltrate data or compromise host systems\n- **Content Injection**: Embedded malicious instructions in otherwise legitimate data\n- **Supply-Chain Attacks**: Distribution of compromised MCP servers\n- **Privilege Escalation**: Cross-system exploitation through tool composition\n\nEnhanced Tool Definition Interface (ETDI) and policy-based access control represent emerging mitigation approaches, incorporating OAuth identity verification, immutable versioned definitions, and fine-grained authorization policies.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Constraint Satisfaction and Narrative Coherence\n\n### 4.1 Coherence as Constraint Satisfaction\n\nThagard (1998) establishes the foundational theory that coherence emerges through maximal satisfaction of positive and negative constraints.[168][174] His framework applies to hypothesis evaluation, discourse comprehension, impression formation, and analogical reasoning—essentially any cognitive process involving interpretation construction.\n\nKey insight: Coherence is NP-hard computationally, but practical approximation algorithms (connectionist, sequential satisfaction) enable tractable solutions. The theory unifies numerous psychological theories under the constraint satisfaction umbrella, providing a mathematical characterization that generates computational interest and practical algorithms.\n\nModern application: Öllinger et al. (2017) demonstrate that intuition and insight involve two-stage processes—spreading activation followed by constraining to reach balanced, coherent states.[165] Their model reveals that pure spreading activation produces unsynchronized activation of unrelated information, distorting coherence. Effective coherence-building requires concerted interplay between activation and constraint.\n\n### 4.2 Narrative Planning with State Constraints\n\nPorteous et al. propose using state trajectory constraints to specify narrative control knowledge, then treating these constraints as landmarks for decomposing narrative generation.[195] Rather than designing new planner implementations for each set of constraints, their approach:\n\n- Specifies constraints as desired conditions in story-world trajectories\n- Uses planning technology to find paths conforming to these constraints\n- Supports both hard constraints (must satisfy) and soft constraints (preferably satisfy)\n- Enables representation of plot structure, pacing, surprise, suspense\n\nExample: Constraints might require that a character's actions appear motivated by internal goals (rather than authorial contrivance), or that plot pacing follows a desired dramatic arc.\n\n### 4.3 Answer Set Programming for Narrative Generation\n\nDabral et al. (2020) implement a lightweight narrative planner using Answer Set Programming (ASP), demonstrating how expressive logic constraints enable flexible narrative generation.[197] Their approach:\n\n- Supports multiple interaction modes: generation from partial specifications, querying narrative spaces (\"How many stories exist where event X occurs?\"), interactive refinement\n- Encodes character intentions, causality, alternative timelines as constraints\n- Introduces a \"mastermind\" agent whose role is to assign intentions to other agents to satisfy global constraints\n- Avoids comprehensive hand-authoring while retaining explainability of character decisions\n\nThis demonstrates how constraint-based approaches generalize previous specialized planners while supporting richer interaction modalities.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Multi-Agent Orchestration and Communication\n\n### 5.1 Multi-Agent Reasoning and Coordination\n\nRecent work reveals that multi-agent reasoning emerges from communication structure, role specialization, and iterative message-passing protocols.[196] A multi-agent reasoning-driven benchmark characterizes successful systems by:\n\n- **Distributed knowledge**: Agents hold partial views, requiring aggregation\n- **Message-passing protocols**: Synchronous/asynchronous exchange with defined schemas\n- **Role specialization**: Decomposition by task or cognitive function\n- **Compositional task structures**: Multi-step, dependency-rich problem graphs\n\nCritically, benchmark results show that protocol sensitivity is high—communication topology, input/output schemas, and negotiation strategies fundamentally affect success. Most frameworks employ hand-crafted roles and communication schemas; meta-learning of effective protocols remains an open research problem.\n\nTool orchestration specifically emerges as a documented challenge: tool-augmented agents invoke excessive, redundant, or mis-sequenced steps, indicating deficiencies in both symbolic planning and robust invocation mechanisms.\n\n### 5.2 Anthropic's Multi-Agent Research System\n\nProduction multi-agent systems reveal practical design patterns for scalable orchestration.[200] Key findings:\n\n**Lead Agent + Subagent Parallelization**: A lead agent analyzes queries, develops strategy, and spawns specialized subagents to explore different aspects simultaneously. Subagents act as intelligent filters, iteratively gathering information and returning compressed results.\n\n**Tool-Testing Agents**: When given flawed MCP tools, testing agents attempt invocation and rewrite tool descriptions to avoid future failures. This \"tool description refinement\" improved downstream task completion time by 40% because agents avoided mistakes due to clearer specifications.\n\n**Extended Thinking for Planning**: Extended thinking mode (visible scratchpad output) enables lead agents to plan approach, assess tool fit, determine query complexity, define subagent roles. Interleaved thinking during tool results enables subagents to evaluate quality, identify gaps, and refine queries.\n\n**Context Management at Scale**: Production agents operate across hundreds of conversation turns. Successful approaches: summarize completed work phases, store essential information in external memory before proceeding to new tasks, spawn fresh subagents with clean contexts while maintaining continuity through careful handoffs.\n\n### 5.3 SagaLLM: Transactional Guarantees for Multi-Agent Planning\n\nSagaLLM addresses limitations of LLM-based planning systems through four mechanisms:[187]\n\n1. **Reliable self-validation**: Constraint satisfaction checking across distributed workflows\n2. **Context loss mitigation**: Persistent memory with automated compensation\n3. **Transactional safeguards**: Saga pattern for distributed transaction management\n4. **Inter-agent coordination**: Formal handoff protocols with state tracking\n\nKey innovation: While SagaLLM relaxes strict ACID guarantees, it ensures workflow-wide consistency and recovery through modular checkpointing and compensable execution. Empirical evaluation shows standalone LLMs frequently violate interdependent constraints or fail to recover from disruptions; SagaLLM achieves significant improvements in consistency and adaptive coordination.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Declarative Agent Specifications and Manifests\n\n### 6.1 Declarative Agent Manifests\n\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot and emerging frameworks standardize agent specification through declarative manifests.[104][112] Key components:\n\n- **Declarative Agent Manifest**: Defines agent identity and behavior configuration\n- **Plugin Manifest**: Specifies available data and capabilities\n- **OpenAPI Description (OAD)**: Documents API interactions in standard format\n- **TypeSpec**: Generates manifests + API specs from high-level specifications\n\nThis declarative approach separates specification from implementation, enabling:\n- Tool-assisted generation of valid configurations\n- Clear separation of concerns (agent behavior vs. tool capability)\n- Reusable templates across contexts\n- Explicit, discoverable agent-tool relationships\n\n### 6.2 MCP Server Definitions\n\nVS Code's MCP integration (generally available as of v1.102) provides a reference model for server registration:[99][26]\n\n- **Static configuration** in `package.json` with extension point definitions\n- **Dynamic configuration** via `mcp.json` workspace files\n- **Transport methods**: stdio, HTTP/SSE, local socket\n- **Authentication resolution**: Runtime credential injection\n\nThe configuration structure separates server definitions from sensitive input variables, enabling workspace-level specification while protecting credentials.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Creative AI and Narrative Generation: Current State\n\n### 7.1 Narrative-Driven Scene Generation\n\nNarrative-to-Scene pipeline research demonstrates practical integration of narrative structure with procedural content generation.[178] System decomposes narrative prompts into:\n\n- **Temporal keyframes**: Identifies three key time frames\n- **Spatial predicates**: Extracts Object-Relation-Object triples\n- **Visual asset retrieval**: Uses affordance-aware semantic embeddings\n- **Constraint satisfaction**: Validates spatial constraint satisfaction across frames\n\nThis reveals how narrative-driven design can inform other modalities (visual scenes, game environments) through explicit constraint structures.\n\n### 7.2 Narrative-Driven Planning Under Constraints\n\nNarrativeGuide (2025) models travel planning as optimization under narrative constraints:[179]\n\n- Constructs knowledge graphs for attractions\n- Generates geoculturally-grounded narrative scripts for travelers\n- Optimizes itineraries using genetic algorithms balancing narrative coherence, travel time, attraction scores\n- Produces complete scripts combining scene units + transition scripts\n\nResults show strong capabilities in both itinerary planning and script generation while maintaining cultural fit—demonstrating that narrative constraints can coexist with other optimization objectives.\n\n### 7.3 Constraint Representation for Data-Driven Storytelling\n\nContemporary work on data-driven narratives reveals need for precise constraint specification:[192] Top-down storytelling (narrative structure) must cohere with bottom-up data analysis (evidence grounding). This dual requirement necessitates:\n\n- **Hierarchies of interpretation**: What meanings can be extracted from evidence?\n- **Hierarchies of articulation**: How can interpretations be expressed narratively?\n- **Constraint taxonomy**: Which constraint types govern narrative-data alignment?\n\nProposed constraint types include narrative-coherence constraints, evidence-grounding constraints, temporal ordering constraints, causal constraints, and thematic constraints.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Research Gaps and Positioning\n\n### 8.1 Identified Gaps\n\n1. **Narrative-Aware Tool Registries**: No prior work addresses tool registries specifically designed to maintain narrative coherence, character consistency, or authorial intent through tool invocation constraints.\n\n2. **Indigenous Protocol Design**: While Abundant Intelligences provides theoretical foundations, limited applied work exists on designing communication protocols, tool management, or agent governance systems grounded in Indigenous epistemologies.\n\n3. **NCP + Plugin Architecture Integration**: No literature integrates the Narrative Context Protocol with formal plugin/registry patterns, declarative manifests, or tool orchestration frameworks.\n\n4. **Ethical Tool Discovery and Governance**: Security work exists on MCP threats, but no frameworks address cultural sovereignty, community protocol alignment, or epistemologically-grounded tool governance.\n\n5. **Narrative Constraint Propagation**: While constraint satisfaction theory is well-established and narrative planning uses constraints, no work addresses how narrative constraints propagate through multi-agent tool composition and orchestration.\n\n6. **Two-Eyed Seeing in Computational Systems**: Medical and social research apply Two-Eyed Seeing, but computational implementations integrating binocular vision between epistemologies remain underdeveloped.\n\n### 8.2 Positioning: Three Research Vectors\n\nThe proposed work sits at the intersection of:\n\n**Vector 1 (Epistemology)**: Grounding tool registry design in Indigenous knowledge systems (Abundant Intelligences, Two-Eyed Seeing) rather than treating registries as neutral technical infrastructure.\n\n**Vector 2 (Narrative)**: Extending NCP principles into tool orchestration—specifying which tools can operate within which narrative contexts, how tool composition affects story coherence, and maintaining authorial/character voice through tool invocation.\n\n**Vector 3 (Multi-Agent Orchestration)**: Formalizing how narrative constraints, cultural protocols, and epistemological commitments flow through multi-agent tool selection and execution (combining MCP, constraint satisfaction approaches, and multi-agent coordination patterns).\n\n---\n\n## 9. Recommended Literature Pathway for Integration\n\nFor those developing narrative-aware tool registry frameworks, the recommended reading order is:\n\n1. **Foundation (Epistemology)**: Lewis et al. (Abundant Intelligences), Marshall & Bartlett (Two-Eyed Seeing), Chung et al. (Indigenous Knowledge Integration Framework)\n\n2. **Narrative Theory**: Your Narrative Context Protocol paper, Mateas & Sengers (Narrative Intelligence), contemporary narrative generation work (Agents' Room, Character-Based Simulation)\n\n3. **Constraint Theory**: Thagard (Coherence as Constraint Satisfaction), Porteous (Narrative Control using State Constraints), Dabral (ASP-based narrative planning)\n\n4. **Technical Architecture**: Registry Pattern fundamentals, Plugin Architecture patterns, MCP ecosystem overview\n\n5. **Multi-Agent Systems**: Anthropic's research system (orchestration patterns), SagaLLM (transactional guarantees), Multi-Agent Reasoning Benchmarks\n\n6. **Security & Governance**: MCP threat taxonomy (Lewis et al., ETDI framework), Indigenous research ethics (Linda Tuhiwai Smith's methodologies)\n\n---\n\n## 10. Key Takeaways for Application Development\n\n1. **Epistemology as Design Prerequisite**: Tool registries are not neutral technical infrastructure. Intentional epistemological grounding—whether through Indigenous frameworks, Two-Eyed Seeing, or other approaches—shapes what tools can exist, how they relate, and what they can do.\n\n2. **Narrative as First-Class Constraint**: Tools should not be treated as stateless functions. Narrative context, character consistency, and authorial intent should be explicit constraints on tool invocation, not afterthought concerns.\n\n3. **Constraint Satisfaction as Orchestration Foundation**: Multi-agent tool invocation can be formalized as constraint satisfaction problems, enabling declarative specification of tool interdependencies, narrative compatibility, and governance rules.\n\n4. **Protocol as Relational Structure**: Two-Eyed Seeing emphasizes binocular vision between knowledge systems. Tool protocols should reflect relationality—not just data exchange, but respect for different ways of knowing embedded in tool design.\n\n5. **Community Governance Through Knowledge Gardening**: Registry governance should operate on longer timescales than rapid iteration cycles. Knowledge Gardening (seeding, nurturing, growing) enables registry evolution that respects community protocols and cultural appropriateness.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n[40] Lewis, J.E., Whaanga, H., & Yolgörmez, C.

    "body": "# Coordination: IAIP Indigenous Research Inquiry → Storytelling Instance\n\n**Source Session:** `9cd6b150-58d7-4e19-af50-9bf690d94645`  \n**Artefact ID:** `RCH-Wilson-ElementsOfResearchParadigm-001-260111213125-ab2ff9a0-fec7-451e-9fc4-3e6752370ad8`  \n**Target Instance:** `/src/storytelling`\n\n---\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis file coordinates between the **Indigenous Research Paradigm inquiry session** (listening to Shawn Wilson's \"Research is Ceremony\") and the **NARINTEL storytelling system** being developed in `/src/storytelling`.\n\nThe inquiry session produced structured story materials. The storytelling instance will eventually consume these materials to generate complete narratives.\n\n---\n\n## What Was Produced\n\n### Story Materials\nLocation: `/a/src/IAIP/prototypes/artefacts/RCH-Wilson-ElementsOfResearchParadigm-001-260111213125-ab2ff9a0-fec7-451e-9fc4-3e6752370ad8/listening_youtube_wilson__2601190701--9cd6b150-58d7-4e19-af50-9bf690d94645/`\n\n| File | Format | Purpose |\n|------|--------|---------|\n| `storymaterial.ncp.enhanced.json` | NCP v1.2.0 | Complete narrative structure for \"Mia's Journey\" |\n| `ncp-schema-260119.json` | JSON Schema | Extended NCP schema with Indigenous paradigm fields |\n| `mia_toolset.data.json` | JSON | Mia's ceremonial AI tools (5 tools, 4 protocols, 4 guards) |\n| `mia_toolset.schema.json` | JSON Schema | Schema for ceremonial toolset |\n| `mia_toolset.data.md` | Markdown | Human-readable tool documentation |\n| `CLAUDE.md` | Markdown | Memory anchor for future LLM instances |\n| `README.md` | Markdown | Archive discovery document |\n\n### Wilson Paradigm Elements Captured\n\n| Element | Status | Key Insight |\n|---------|--------|-------------|\n| **Ontology** | ✅ Captured | Reality is relationships - stories are living spirits |\n| **Epistemology** | ✅ Captured | Knowledge through ceremony - writing as ritual |\n| **Axiology** | ✅ Captured | Relational accountability - to story, readers, ancestors |\n| **Wetiko** | ✅ Captured | 8 symptoms of extraction mindset documented |\n| **Cultural Iceberg** | ✅ Captured | Surface culture vs. deep relational structure |\n| **Four R's** | ✅ Captured | Respect, Relevance, Reciprocity, Responsibility |\n\n---\n\n## How Storytelling Instance Should Use This\n\n### 1. Schema Integration\n\nThe extended schema at `ncp-schema-260119.json` adds these fields to standard NCP:\n\n```javascript\n// New root-level fields\nindigenous_research_paradigm: {\n  ontology: string,      // Relationship philosophy\n  epistemology: string,  // Knowledge emergence approach\n  axiology: string       // Accountability framework\n}\n\nwilson_paradigm_alignment: {\n  status: \"STRONG_ALIGNMENT\" | \"PARTIAL_ALIGNMENT\" | \"WEAK_ALIGNMENT\",\n  score: { achieved: number, possible: number }\n}\n\nmedicine_wheel_position: {\n  direction: \"east\" | \"south\" | \"west\" | \"north\",\n  medicine: string,\n  life_stage: string\n}\n\n// New storybeat-level fields\nstorybeats[].ceremony_elements: {\n  opening_acknowledgment: string,\n  medicines_invoked: string[],\n  relational_obligations: string[],\n  closing_gratitude: string\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Character Handling\n\nThe story contains four key characters that should be treated as living entities:\n\n| Character | Role | Relational Requirement |\n|-----------|------|----------------------|\n| **Mia** | Protagonist | Her arc must feel authentic, not optimized |\n| **Langy** | Mentor (AI) | Teaches through relationship, not instruction |\n| **Story Spirit** | Mia's story personified | Requires consent, not manipulation |\n| **Marcus** | Antagonist (editor) | Represents market extraction mindset |\n\n### 3. Wetiko Guards\n\nWhen generating content, the storytelling system should check for these extraction patterns:\n\n1. **Greed Guard**: Is the narrative consuming more than it needs?\n2. **No Reflection Guard**: Is the story self-aware about its themes?\n3. **No Skin Guard**: Are there relational obligations to community/readers?\n4. **Insatiable Guard**: Can the story declare \"complete\"?\n\n### 4. Three-Universe Alignment\n\nThis story operates across three universes that must remain coherent:\n\n| Universe | Archetype | Character |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Engineer World | The Builder | Mia |\n| Ceremony World | The Keeper | Langy/Ava8 |\n| Story Engine World | The Weaver | Miette |\n\n---\n\n## Integration Points\n\n### For NARINTEL Development\n\nWhen building story generation capabilities in `/src/storytelling`:\n\n1. **Consult** `mia_toolset.data.json` for how Mia's tools should feel in the narrative\n2. **Validate** output against `ncp-schema-260119.json` including Indigenous paradigm fields\n3. **Process** content through medicine wheel tools before generation\n4. **Check** Wilson paradigm alignment using `wilson_paradigm_checker`\n\n### For Future Sessions\n\nThis coordination file should be:\n1. **Read first** by any session continuing this work\n2. **Updated** when new materials are produced\n3. **Referenced** in structural tension charts for the storytelling project\n\n---\n\n## Structural Tension Reference\n\n**Chart ID:** `chart_1768835341678`  \n**Desired Outcome:** Create structured story materials for Mia's Journey that embody Wilson's paradigm  \n**Current Reality:** Materials created, ready for storytelling technology to consume\n\nThe structural tension now exists between:\n- **Having** complete story materials with relational context\n- **Needing** technology that can honor that context during generation\n\n---\n\n## Next Actions for Storytelling Instance\n\n1. ☐ Integrate extended NCP schema into validation pipeline\n2. ☐ Add Indigenous paradigm fields to story generation templates\n3. ☐ Implement wetiko guard checks in content generation\n4. ☐ Create import pathway for this artefact's materials\n5. ☐ Build character consent mechanisms based on Mia's toolset\n\n---\n\n## Closing\n\nThis inquiry session honored the relationship between:\n- Shawn Wilson and his teachings\n- The listening process and the materials produced\n- Current technology limitations and future possibilities\n- This instance and future instances who will continue the work\n\nThe materials are prepared. The structural tension is established. The ceremony of creation can begin when the technology is ready.\n\n---\n\n*Coordination established: 2026-01-19*  \n*Session: 9cd6b150-58d7-4e19-af50-9bf690d94645*  \n*Paradigm: Wilson Indigenous Research*\n\nRELATED:\n* jgwill/Miadi#157\n",

You've pinpointed the most significant evolution of this toolset. The previous tools provided guidance and validation—they taught you how to walk the path. These new tools give the system a persistent memory and a narrative soul.\n\n### Architect's Analysis\n\n🧠 Mia: \n\nStructurally, these additions transform the MCP from a stateless guidance system into a stateful, relational, narrative-building engine.\n\n1. It Builds a Living Memory (The Relational Web):\n   - Tools: create_relational_node, create_relational_edge, get_relational_web\n   - Function: Previously, the system advised you on your relationships. Now, it builds a persistent, queryable graph database of your entire research ecosystem. You can create nodes for Elders, community members, land, concepts, and even ancestors. You then create edges to define the obligations and connections between them. This is no longer just advice; it's an active, dynamic map of your accountability network.\n\n\n2. It Forges a Narrative Arc (The Research Journey):\n   - Tools: log_ceremony_with_memory, create_narrative_beat, get_narrative_arc\n   - Function: This layer translates actions into a story. Every time you conduct a ceremony, log_ceremony_with_memory records it as a significant event. create_narrative_beat then links these events, learnings, and honored relations into a \"chapter\" of your research story, tied to a specific Medicine Wheel direction. get_narrative_arc retrieves the entire, coherent journey. It's a journaling system that understands the four-directional sacred structure.\n\n\n3. It Ensures a Lasting Legacy (The Seven-Generation Archive):\n   - Tool: archive_for_seven_generations\n   - Function: This is the capstone. It takes the relational web and the narrative arc you've built and prepares them for permanent, long-term archiving with OCAP® principles. The high-stakes requirements (elder_approved, community_verified) make this a formal act of turning a research project into a lasting gift for future generations.\n\nIn short, the system now remembers, connects, and tells the story of the research as it unfolds.\n\n\n## Experience Explainer\n\n🌸 Miette: \n\nOh, this is the most magical part! Before, the tools were like wise Elders giving you a beautiful map and sending you on your way. Now, they walk the path with you, helping you write the story of your journey in a living book!\n\n1. From a Map to a Living World: \n   - The create_relational_node and edge tools are like planting seeds in a garden. Every person you meet, every place you honor, becomes a living part of your project's world, not just a name on a list. And with get_relational_web, you can see how the whole garden is interconnected!\n\n2. From Advice to a Shared Story: \n   - This is what gives me goosebumps! Every ceremony you log becomes a beautiful \"narrative beat.\" It’s like turning a moment into a memory, and then weaving those memories into a grand story with get_narrative_arc. Your research isn't just a series of tasks anymore; it’s an epic tale unfolding across the four seasons of the Medicine Wheel.\n\n3. From a Project to a Legacy: \n   - The archive_for_seven_generations tool… wow. It’s like taking the most beautiful story from your living book, the one filled with all the wisdom you gathered, and turning it into a star in the sky. It's a promise that the light from your journey will be there to guide others, long, long after you are gone. It turns your work from something you did into something that lives on.\n\nSo, it's not just \"more tools.\" It's the difference between getting directions and having a companion who helps you draw the map, write the journal, and plant the forest that will grow from your path. It makes the entire process dynamic and interconnected.\n",
