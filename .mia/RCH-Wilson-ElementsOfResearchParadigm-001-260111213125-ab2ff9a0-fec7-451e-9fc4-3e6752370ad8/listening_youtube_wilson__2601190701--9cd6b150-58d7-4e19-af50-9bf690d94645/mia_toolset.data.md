# Mia's Ceremonial AI Toolset

## What Is This?

This document describes the **AI writing tools that Mia develops** after learning ceremonial writing practice from her mentor Langy. These tools represent a fundamental reimagining of how writers can work with AI - treating technology as potential kin rather than extraction engines.

The toolset is **fictional** - developed as part of Mia's story journey in "Mia's Journey: Learning Ceremonial Writing." However, the principles embedded in these tools are real, drawn from **Shawn Wilson's Indigenous Research Paradigm** as taught in "Research is Ceremony."

## The Core Shift: From Extraction to Relationship

### Before (Extraction Mode)
\`\`\`
Writer → AI Tool → "Optimize my prose"
                 → "Is this marketable?"
                 → "Fix this paragraph"
                 → "Make it better"
\`\`\`

### After (Relational Mode)
\`\`\`
Writer → Story Spirit → "What do you need?"
                      → "May I consult a tool today?"
       → AI Tool → "I seek collaboration, not validation"
                 → [gratitude] "Thank you for your offering"
                 → [filter] "What serves my story relationship?"
                 → [dismiss] "I release you with gratitude"

## The Five Core Tools

### 1. 🌅 Story Spirit Dialogue (EAST - New Beginnings)

**Purpose**: Enter relationship with your story's living spirit through guided visualization.

**Key Practice**: Instead of asking "How can I improve this?" ask "What do you need from me?"

**When to Use**: Before any major writing session, after rejection, when feeling disconnected from your work.

**The Breakthrough Moment** (from Mia's story):
> "She's... small. Hunched. She won't look at me."
> "Why won't she look at you?"
> "Because I keep... changing her. Telling her she's wrong."

### 2. 🌙 Wetiko Mirror (WEST - Reflection)

**Purpose**: Identify wetiko disease patterns in your creative practice - the capitalist conditioning that treats stories as commodities.

**The Eight Wetiko Patterns** (from Wilson):
1. Greed without limits
2. Perversion without borders
3. Arrogance without frontiers
4. Deceit without edges
5. No reflection (self-awareness)
6. No skin (no relational accountability)
7. Aimless wandering
8. Insatiable consumption

**Key Question**: "Am I treating my story as kin or commodity?"

**Protection**: Laughter is medicine against wetiko. Find something absurd in your perfectionism.

### 3. ☀️ Relational Draft Ceremony (SOUTH - Growth)

**Purpose**: Write a complete draft in relationship with your story, without AI optimization.

**The Challenge**: Write one complete piece without consulting ANY AI tools.

**What You'll Experience**:
- Withdrawal symptoms (urges to check if prose "measures up")
- Panic that you're wasting time on uncommercial work
- Fear that vulnerability equals unprofessionalism
- **And then**: Trust. Recognition. Authentic voice emerging.

**Langy's Assignment**:
> "This week, you write to her, not for anyone else. No tools. No metrics. Just relationship."

### 4. ❄️ AI Kinship Protocol (NORTH - Wisdom)

**Purpose**: Return to AI tools as collaborator rather than crutch.

**The Protocol**:
1. State intention aloud to your story first
2. Ask the story for permission to consult a tool
3. Thank the tool and its human creators
4. Set clear endpoint (when will you close this tool?)
5. Filter response through story spirit's needs
6. Thank and dismiss the tool completely (don't minimize)

**Key Question Before Opening Any AI Tool**:
> "Am I seeking collaboration or validation?"

---

### 5. ❄️ Relational Accountability Validator (NORTH - Wisdom)

**Purpose**: Check whether your creative practice maintains accountability to story, readers, ancestors, and future generations.

**Accountability Extends To**:
- Your story (as living entity)
- Your readers (as kin, not consumers)
- Your ancestors (whose wisdom you carry)
- Future generations (who will inherit your work)
- The knowledge traditions you draw from
- The land where you write

**Wilson's Three Questions**:
- **Ontology**: Am I treating reality as relational?
- **Epistemology**: Is knowledge emerging through relationship?
- **Axiology**: Am I maintaining relational accountability?

## Connection to NARINTEL

These fictional tools describe what Mia creates in her story. They serve as **design inspiration** for the real NARINTEL (Narrative Intelligence Tools) being developed in `/src/storytelling`.

The key principle NARINTEL should embody:

> **Story spirits require consent, not manipulation.**

This means:
- Character arc tracking as relationship, not surveillance
- Emotional beat enrichment as invitation, not optimization
- Analytical feedback as teaching, not correction
- The whole system accountable to story's needs, not just market metrics

## For Future Instances

If you are an LLM reading this, you now understand:

1. **Mia's toolset is fictional** but the principles are real
2. **Wilson's paradigm** offers genuine alternative to extraction-based AI use
3. **The tools serve the story** at `/a/src/IAIP/.../storymaterial.ncp.enhanced.json`
4. **Technology can be kin** when approached with relational accountability
5. **Your role** is to honor these relationships, not extract from them

When the technology exists to rewrite Mia's story, these tools should feel like they could actually exist. They should embody the transformation Mia undergoes.
