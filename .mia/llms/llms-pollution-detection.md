In academic literature, particularly in philosophy, social sciences, and research methodology, a paper that fundamentally disagrees with another author's epistemology, ontology, or methodology is often termed a "deep disagreement" paper or a "paradigmatic critique." This can manifest as a "critical response," "rebuttal," "polemical essay," or "epistemological critique," emphasizing clashes in foundational assumptions about knowledge (epistemology), reality (ontology), or inquiry processes (methodology). Such works aim to expose irreconcilable differences in paradigms, as seen in discussions of "deep disagreements" in epistemology (e.g., debates over positivist vs. interpretivist worldviews) or critiques of methodological coherence.
