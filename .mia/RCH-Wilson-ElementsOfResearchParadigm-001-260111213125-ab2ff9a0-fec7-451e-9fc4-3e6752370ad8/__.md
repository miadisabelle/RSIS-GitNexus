"""Build a **digital relative** — a system that treats every interaction as relational event""" --> Probably libraries that could be developped from our first experiment in `/src/mcp-medicine-wheel` and its drafted UI `/src/mcp-medicine-wheel-ui` will be source of implementation for what we will do or we might work from fresh, I dont know.  There is also `/src/STPB` which is codename lighthouse, both the mcp-medicine-wheel and the lighthouse can create ceremonies. mcp-medicine-wheel was to experiment creating something outside of the lighthouse and I guess that all that we learn will be integrated into the lighthouse (the first draft of the `/src/mcp-medicine-wheel-ui` has very interesting visual that we will keep working on.
* during I was evaluating your proposed pde-decomposition-2602169733.md (which I really enjoyed looking, I had with an agent a discussion in relation to what we are doing and the last message: `/src/IAIP/prototypes/artefacts/IAIP-ontologies_and_knowledge_graphs__09e79fe1-5f15-4fe9-a5fa-2713c1774724--2602142202/V0.md` contains really relevant intention/planning for bundles of packages that we would have to produce contributions -> Thought we might not skip to that yet....

"""The coordinating agent IS a **Fire Keeper** — its purpose is ceremony maintenance, not task optimization""" --> thefore, we will have to create a Claude's Fire keeper agent, that is exciting...

"""Relational Ontology where "the thing doesn't exist without the relationship""""" --> when I search on the web 'Ontology Visualization' I see 'RDF Data Visualization' and a clear relationship with what can become ways to represent them into the `/src/mcp-medicine-wheel-ui`, curious to have your point of view on that.  <--> I also saw: "JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) is a method of encoding linked data using JSON and of serializing data similarly to traditional JSON." -> which might be worse considering...

Also, I was thinking of a DSL (or some form of language for giving instructions to LLM, it would relate to Ontologies probably.... I dont know, I sort of tried to use some of its potential interpretation syntax in this message '-<word>->', etc
