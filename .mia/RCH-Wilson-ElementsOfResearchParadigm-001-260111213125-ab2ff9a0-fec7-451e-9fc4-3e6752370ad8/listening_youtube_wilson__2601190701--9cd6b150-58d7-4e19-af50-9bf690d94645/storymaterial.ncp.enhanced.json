Sienna learns research isn't extraction but relationship-building. She develops a revolutionary methodology documenting reef ecosystems as living relationships, facing institutional resistance while her former colleague Marcus attempts to patent her grandmother's knowledge. The climax occurs when Sienna must choose between academic validation and protecting sacred knowledge, ultimately creating a new research collective that bridges Indigenous and Western science through 'filament mapping' - a practice recognizing all entities as interconnected spirits.",
